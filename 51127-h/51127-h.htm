<p class="chaptitle">WANTED: A MAN OF NERVE.</p>


<p>"Mr. Amos Murgatroyd?"</p>

<p>"My name."</p>

<p>Amos Murgatroyd whirled around in his office chair
and measured his caller with a pair of little, gimlet eyes.
The caller, at the same time, was measuring Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>The young man who had entered the musty office of
the loan broker and was now undergoing his scrutiny,
stood straight as a plumb line, his shoulders squared, his
lithe, well-set-up form "at attention." He wore a cap,
and his clothes were of dark blue and of a semi-military
cut.</p>

<p>He was prepossessing in appearance, which, most decidedly,
the loan broker was not.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd's face was too lean and hard, his eyes too
sharp and shifty, to give one a very exalted idea of his
character.</p>

<p>The caller drew a folded newspaper from the breast
pocket of his coat and laid it on the broker's desk.</p>

<p>"Are you the man who put that 'ad' in the paper?"
inquired the youth.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd picked a pair of nose glasses off his vest,
carefully adjusted them, and lifted the paper. The
following marked paragraph riveted his attention:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wanted: A man of nerve, one who has had some
experience with flying machines and can handle a gasoline
motor. To such a person a chance is offered to
fly for fame and fortune in a new aëroplane. Sand and
sagacity absolutely essential. Call on or address, A.
Murgatroyd, Brown Block, Jamestown, North Dakota.</p></blockquote>

<p>The broker dropped the paper, leaned back in his
chair, and swept the glasses off his nose. Tapping
the glasses against the knuckles of his left hand, he continued
to regard the youth.</p>

<p>"Well?" he growled. "It's my 'ad.' What of it?"</p>

<p>"I've come several hundred miles to answer it in person."</p>

<p>"You? Why, I advertised for a man, not a boy."</p>

<p>"What difference does that make, so long as I can
do the work?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Amos Murgatroyd had no answer for this, and his
remarks took another tack.</p>

<p>"Had any experience with aëroplanes?"</p>

<p>"No, but I have had a good deal to do with dirigible
balloons. If you're hunting for a man who is experienced
with aëroplanes, Mr. Murgatroyd, I guess
you'll have to hunt for a long time. Heavier-than-air
machines are only just beginning to come to the front,
and the supply of experienced drivers is limited. It was
the chance to familiarize myself with flying of that kind
that brought me here."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd continued to tap reflectively with his
glasses.</p>

<p>"Do you know that the man who invented the aëroplane
fell with one of the machines and was killed?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"I heard that there had been an accident here, recently,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"That was ten days ago, over in the park. The
aëroplane turned turtle, dropped fifty feet, and Traquair
was badly smashed. He lived about fifteen minutes
and wasn't able to speak a word. The machine may
be wrong in principle, I don't know that, but I've got
to get some reliable person, who's not too much afraid
of risking his neck, to learn the machine and then give
an exhibition for the government, up at Fort Totten.
The trial is set for two weeks from to-day. There's
not much time, you see, to learn the ropes."</p>

<p>"I believe I could learn the ropes," said the other confidently.
"I seem to have a knack for picking up such
things."</p>

<p>"If anything happens to you, your relatives may come
at me for damages."</p>

<p>"So far as I know, Mr. Murgatroyd, I haven't any
relatives."</p>

<p>The beady, gimlet eyes gleamed with undisguised satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You will have to sign a paper," went on Murgatroyd,
"releasing me from all responsibility, financial or
otherwise, in case any accident happens."</p>

<p>"I'm willing," was the cool response. "It can't be
that you have very much confidence in your aëroplane,
Mr. Murgatroyd."</p>

<p>"Solid ground is good enough for me. If man was
intended to fly he would have been born with wings.
That's where I stand in this aëronautical game. Besides,
Traquair invented the machine&mdash;I didn't; and the fact
that Traquair was killed by his own invention doesn't
give me superlative confidence in it."</p>

<p>The youth wondered why Murgatroyd was taking
such an interest in a machine that did not command
his confidence. The next moment the broker explained
this point.</p>

<p>"Traquair owed me money, and the machine was the
only thing belonging to him that I could get hold of.
If the test at Fort Totten is satisfactory, the war department
will buy the aëroplane at a good figure. This
is the only way I can get back the loan, you see?"</p>

<p>"What are you willing to pay for the work you want
done?"</p>

<p>The youth's tone was chilling and business-like. He
was anything but favorably impressed with Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>"I won't pay a red cent," declared the broker. "I'll
furnish the aëroplane, and you can use it for practice. If
you please the war department, and they pay fifteen
thousand for the machine, we'll split the amount even.
That's fair enough. I won't be throwing good money
after bad, and success or failure is put up to you."</p>

<p>"Is the machine you have the one that killed Traquair?"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd gave a choppy laugh.</p>

<p>"I should say not! There was nothing but kindling
wood left of that machine. Traquair was intending to
fly for the government, and he had a machine constructed
especially for the purpose. It's in storage at
Fort Totten now. The machine he was using here was
the first one he built. By the way, young man, what's
your name?"</p>

<p>"King, Matt King."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd gave a grunt of surprise, jammed his
glasses on his nose, and stared at his caller with renewed
interest; then, suddenly, he pressed a push button
at the side of his desk.</p>

<p>A clerk appeared, a wizened, dried-up little man, who
came in with a cringing air.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Murgatroyd?"</p>

<p>"File 'K,' Prebbles. And dust it off. Why don't you
go around this place with a duster, once in a while?
The older you get, Prebbles, the less you seem to know."</p>

<p>The clerk winced. With a deferential bow, he turned
and slunk out of the room. He returned in a few minutes,
a duster in one hand and a battered letter file in
the other. Murgatroyd took the file on his desk and
sent Prebbles away with a curt gesture.</p>

<p>After a brief search through the file, the broker developed
a number of newspaper clippings.</p>

<p>"That your picture?" he asked, holding up a clipping
with an electrotype reproduction of the king of the motor
boys at the top of it.</p>

<p>"It's supposed to be," smiled Matt, wondering why
this close-fisted broker had gone to so much trouble
to collect the clippings.</p>

<p>"You had a flying machine called the <i>Hawk</i>, quite a
while ago, didn't you?" pursued Murgatroyd, studying
the clippings.</p>

<p>"It was a dirigible balloon," explained Matt. "Correctly
speaking, a flying machine is not a motor suspended
from a gas bag."</p>

<p>"Quite right. I got these clippings from a clipping
bureau in the East, and ever since I found this aëroplane
on my hands I've been trying to locate you. Finally
I had to give up, and then it was that I put that 'ad'
in the paper. And now, here you come answering the
'ad'! Looks like fate had something to do with this,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Just a coincidence," answered Matt, "and not such a
remarkable coincidence, either. If you knew me better,
Mr. Murgatroyd, you'd understand how anxious I am to
become familiar with every sort of machine propelled by
a gasoline motor. It's the coming power"&mdash;Matt's gray
eyes brightened enthusiastically&mdash;"and as motors are improved,
and their weight reduced in direct ratio with the
increase in the horse power, the explosive engine will
be used in ways as yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right," cut in Murgatroyd, who was coldly
commercial and as far removed from anything like enthusiasm
as night is from day. "A gasoline engine is
a noisy, dirty machine and smells to high heaven. But
that's neither here nor there. Will you take hold of this
aëroplane matter, learn how to run the Traquair invention,
and then test it out at Fort Totten, two weeks
from to-day?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll think it over," said Motor Matt.</p>

<p>He would not have taken a minute to consider the
matter if he had been more favorably impressed with
Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>"I can't wait very long for you to make up your
mind," went on the broker, visibly disappointed. "There's
only two weeks between now and the Fort Totten trials."</p>

<p>"I'll give you an answer by to-morrow morning,"
and Matt turned toward the door.</p>

<p>"Fame and fortune are in your grasp," urged Murgatroyd.
"Don't let 'em slide through your fingers."</p>

<p>Without answering, but nodding a good day to the
broker, Matt stepped into the outer room.</p>

<p>As he passed through this other office, he saw Prebbles
on a high stool, humped over a ledger. The clerk's
eye shade and little bald head, and his thin, crooked
body, gave him the grotesque appearance of a frog,
roosting on a stone, and getting ready to jump.</p>

<p>Matt passed on into the hall. Before he could descend
the stairs he heard a hissing sound behind him.
Turning, he saw the clerk standing in the open door,
touching his lips with a finger in token of silence.</p>

<p>Matt paused with his hand on the stair rail, and the
clerk came gliding toward him.</p>

<p>"Don't have anythin' to do with him," said Prebbles,
in a tremulous whisper; "he's a robber."</p>

<p>"Who's a robber?" returned Matt.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd. He's a skinflint and hasn't any more
heart than a stone. He's a robber, I tell you; and, anyhow,
if you try to run that machine you'll get killed.
Traquair got killed, and he invented it, and knew more
about it than you can ever learn. If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A buzzer began to sound its call in the outer office.
Prebbles whirled and shuffled away. Pausing at the
door, he turned to repeat, in a stage whisper:</p>

<p>"Leave him alone, I tell you. He's a robber, and
you'll get killed."</p>

<p>Then Prebbles vanished, and Matt went thoughtfully
down the stairs.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">FOILING A SCOUNDREL.</p>


<p>Near Jamestown the "Jim" River forms a loop, encircling
a generous stretch of timber. Wherever there
is timber, in any prairie country, there is an invitation
for men to make a park; so the ground encompassed by
this loop of the river was beautified and obtained the
name of "City Park."</p>

<p>After leaving the broker's office, Matt started for the
park. In the outskirts of town he met a youngster walking
in the direction of the river, with a fishpole over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hello," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Hello yourself," answered the boy.</p>

<p>"Do you know where Mr. Traquair lost his life in
that flying machine?"</p>

<p>"I guess yuh don't live in Jimtown, do yuh?" returned
the boy. "Everybody around here knows where <i>that</i>
happened."</p>

<p>"No," said Matt, "I only reached Jamestown last
night."</p>

<p>"Well, the' was a hull crowd o' us seen Traquair
when his flyin' machine flopped over. He come down
like a piece o' lead, all mixed up with ropes, an' canvas,
an' things. Gee, but that was a smash. I was one o' the
kids that went to tell Mrs. Traquair. She was allers
afeared Traquair 'u'd git a drop, so she never went to
see him do his flyin', an' she never let any o' the kids
go, nuther. I wisht I hadn't gone. Say, I dream about
that there accident 'most ev'ry night, an' it skeers me
stiff."</p>

<p>"I'll give you half a dollar," went on Matt, "if you'll
take me to the scene of the accident. Will you?"</p>

<p>"You've bought somethin', mister," grinned the boy.
"I was goin' fishin', but I'd pass up a circus if some un
offered me half a dollar."</p>

<p>They pushed on toward the park.</p>

<p>"Fellers that try to fly ain't got as much sense as the
law allows, I guess," remarked the boy. "Ever'body
said Traquair 'u'd break his neck, an' that's what happened."</p>

<p>"What kind of a machine did he have?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Doggone if I know. It had wings, an' machinery,
an' a thing that whirled behind, an' three bicycle wheels,
an' rudders, an' I dunno what-all."</p>

<p>"What were the bicycle wheels for?" asked Matt, interested.</p>

<p>"Traquair had to take a runnin' start afore he got wind
enough under his wings to lift him. When the wheels
begun to leave ground, he turned the power onto the
whirlin' thing behind, an' that made him scoot up into
the air; then, somehow, he folded the bicycle wheels up
under the machine."</p>

<p>"Did Traquair ever do much flying?"</p>

<p>"Did he? Well, I guess! The day before he got killed
he was in the air as much as two hours, twistin' an' turnin'
an' floppin' ev'ry which way, jest like a big chicken
hawk. The' wasn't much wind, that time, an' people say
that's how he was able to keep right side up. The day
he dropped, the wind was purty middlin' strong from
the west."</p>

<p>"How did the accident happen?"</p>

<p>"That's more'n anybody knows. Traquair was skimmin'
over the tops o' the trees, an' a big crowd was
down on the ground lookin' at him; then, all to oncet
the' was a snap, like somethin' had busted. The wind
grabbed holt o' them canvas wings an' slammed it plumb
over, the hull bizness droppin' so quick we hadn't much
more'n time to git out o' the way."</p>

<p>By this time Matt and the boy had reached a cleared
space among the trees. In the middle of it was a level,
grassless stretch, almost as hard as a board floor.</p>

<p>"There, mister," said the boy, pointing, "is where
Traquair used to start. He'd git his bicycle wheels
to whirlin' at one end o' that tennis ground, an' when he
reached t'other end o' it he was in the air. He was comin'
back to the startin' place when he dropped. Here's
the place."</p>

<p>The boy stepped off to the left and pointed to a spot
where the earth was grewsomely gouged and torn.</p>

<p>"Traquair was crazy," observed the boy, as Matt
stepped toward the bruised turf, and stood there reflectively.
"Ev'rybody says his flyin' machine was a fool
killer."</p>

<p>"Traquair was a great man, my lad," answered Matt,
"and a martyr to science. He gave up his life trying
to help the human race conquer the air. Don't call
him crazy."</p>

<p>"Gee, mister," scoffed the boy, "he'd better have helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
his folks 'stead o' givin' so much time to the human
race. Mrs. Traquair had to take in washin' to keep
the fambly in grub."</p>

<p>Matt kicked up a twisted bolt.</p>

<p>"That's a momentum," said the boy.</p>

<p>"I guess you mean memento," laughed Matt, tossing
the bolt away.</p>

<p>"Mebby it's that where you come from," persisted
the boy doggedly, "but it's momentum out here in Dakoty.
Things is diff'rent in the Northwest to what they
is in the East."</p>

<p>"Where does Mrs. Traquair live?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"What hotel yuh stoppin' to, mister?"</p>

<p>"Gladstone House."</p>

<p>"Then you can pass Mrs. Traquair's shack right on the
way back to the hotel," and the boy proceeded to give
Matt minute instructions as to the way he should go in
order to reach the house.</p>

<p>Matt flipped a silver coin to the youngster, and turned
and started back toward the town. The boy pushed the
coin into his pocket and went whistling in the direction
of the river.</p>

<p>Several things were drawing Motor Matt in the direction
of the Traquair home. Mainly, he distrusted
Murgatroyd, and thought that perhaps Mrs. Traquair
might be able to tell him something about the man.
Then, too, Matt was anxious to learn what he could
about the Traquair aëroplane, and felt sure there were
papers containing drawings or descriptions at the house
which would give a tolerably clear idea of the machine.</p>

<p>The Traquair home was in a squalid neighborhood.
Most of the houses were tumbledown structures with
windows ornamented with old garments wherever a pane
of glass happened to be missing. But, despite its unpainted
walls and sagging roof, the Traquair house had
about it an air of neatness that distinguished it from
its neighbors. There was no rubbish in the front yard,
and two pieces of broken sewer pipe, set on end near
the gate, had been filled with earth and were blooming
with flowers.</p>

<p>In the rear were two long lines of drying clothes.
A pang of pity went to Matt's heart. No matter how
heavily the hand of grief had fallen on Mrs. Traquair, she
could not neglect the toil necessary to supply the needs
of herself and of her fatherless children.</p>

<p>Three youngsters&mdash;a boy and two girls, the boy being
the oldest and not over six&mdash;stood in a frightened huddle
on the front walk, near the gate. The smaller of
the two girls was crying.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Matt, halting beside the
forlorn little group.</p>

<p>"We're 'fraid to go in the house," answered the boy,
looking up at Matt.</p>

<p>"Do you live there?"</p>

<p>"Yes'r, but we're 'fraid. He's in there with mom,
an' he's talkin' like he was mad."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Teddy Traquair. I'm six, an' sis, here, is risin' five.
Mary Jane's only three."</p>

<p>"Who's talking with your mother, Ted?"</p>

<p>"Murg. I hate him, he's so mean to mom. He was
mean to pap, too. But pap's dead&mdash;he got kilt when
the flyin' machine dropped."</p>

<p>There was a pathetic side to this for a lad with
a heart as soft as Matt's, but just then he had no time
for that phase of the matter. The windows of the front
room of the house were open, and covered with mosquito
net. Voices could be heard coming from the
front room&mdash;a woman's voice, tearful and full of entreaty,
and a man's sharp, clean-cut, and almost brutal.</p>

<p>Quietly Matt passed through the gate and took up
his post near one of the windows.</p>

<p>"You sign this paper," Murgatroyd was saying, "and
I'll give you a receipt for two years' interest. What
more do you expect?"</p>

<p>"I can't sign away all my rights to my husband's invention,
Mr. Murgatroyd!" a woman's voice answered.
"The interest for two years is only three hundred dollars,
and that machine he sent to Fort Totten cost nearly
a thousand dollars to build. It isn't right, Mr. Murgatroyd,
for you to take the machine the government is
thinking of buying, and all my interest in poor Harry's
invention, for just three hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Oh, you know a heap about business, you do, don't
you?" snarled Murgatroyd. "What good's the flying
machine, anyway? It killed your husband, and it's likely
to kill anybody else that tries to run it. By taking over
the invention, I feel as though I was loading up with
a white elephant, but I've got a chance to get a young
fellow to try and fly in that aëroplane at Fort Totten.
I'll have to pay him a lot of money to do it, and before
I make an arrangement with him I've got to have your
name down in black and white to this paper. Do you
think for a minute I'm going to spend my good money,
paying this young fellow two or three thousand dollars
to risk his neck in that machine, when I haven't got
any writing from you to protect me? Sign this paper.
If you don't, I'll come here and take everything you've
got in the house to pay that hundred and fifty, interest.
Don't whine around about it, because it won't do any
good. If you want to keep a roof over your head, you
do what I say&mdash;and do it quick."</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the harsh brutality
of the loan broker's words. The ruffianly bullyragging
was apparent to Matt, even though he could not see
what was taking place in the room, and his blood began
to boil.</p>

<p>"I can't do what you ask, Mr. Murgatroyd," said the
woman brokenly. "When the two years had passed,
you'd have the homestead, and the invention, and everything
I've got. My duty to my children&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A savage exclamation came to Matt's ears, followed
by a cry from the woman and the clatter of an overturned
chair. Prebbles had said that Murgatroyd was a
robber. Matt, of course, could not understand all the
ins and outs of the present situation, but he understood
enough to know that the broker was seeking to browbeat
a defenseless woman, and to intimidate her into
signing away rights which meant much to her and her
children.</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation, the king of the motor
boys leaped through the window&mdash;with more or less damage
to the mosquito netting.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MATT MAKES AN INVESTMENT.</p>


<p>Murgatroyd, his face distorted with anger and his little
eyes snapping viciously, was clutching a slender, middle-aged
woman by the arm. He had leaped at her, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
a burst of rage, overturning the chair, which happened
to stand in his way.</p>

<p>Matt's unceremonious entrance into the room startled
Murgatroyd. Releasing his grasp of Mrs. Traquair's
arm, he fell back a step, staring at Matt as though at a
ghost.</p>

<p>Mrs. Traquair was so desperate and frightened that
she was not nearly so startled by the lad's spring through
the window as was Murgatroyd. From Matt's manner
she was not long in realizing that fate had sent her a
champion at just the moment when she needed one most.
Instinctively, she drew toward the youth, half fearful
and half appealing.</p>

<p>"Ah, King!" exclaimed Murgatroyd, struggling to
get the whip hand of himself. "Rather a peculiar way
you have of coming into a house," he added, with some
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"It looked as though I was needed," returned Matt
grimly.</p>

<p>"You'd better look again. You're not needed. This
is a little money transaction between Mrs. Traquair and
myself. Isn't that so, Mrs. Traquair?" he queried, turning
to the woman.</p>

<p>"Y-e-s," answered Mrs. Traquair, her voice so low
it was almost a whisper.</p>

<p>"Don't butt in here, King," scowled Murgatroyd.
"You hear what the lady says. This is none of your
business."</p>

<p>"That's where I differ from you," said Matt sturdily.
"If I'm not mistaken, you were using me as a club to
drive Mrs. Traquair into signing that paper," and he
nodded toward a document that was lying on the table
near pen and ink.</p>

<p>"Don't make any misstatements, sir," blustered the
broker.</p>

<p>"And don't you," cautioned Matt. "I overheard you
tell Mrs. Traquair that you would have to pay a thousand
or two in order to get me to risk my life flying
that aëroplane. As a matter of fact, Mr. Murgatroyd,
you did not offer to pay me a cent. I was to exhibit
the machine, then, if the government bought it for fifteen
thousand dollars, I was to have half."</p>

<p>The red ran into Murgatroyd's face.</p>

<p>"How do you know that I was referring to you?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"I know it, and that's enough." Matt picked the paper
from the table. "I'll just look over this and see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give that to me!" cried Murgatroyd, stepping toward
Matt and making a grab at the document.</p>

<p>Matt jumped back quickly and thrust the paper behind
him.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Traquair," said he to the woman, "I want to
be a friend of yours. May I read this?"</p>

<p>"So&mdash;so far as I am concerned," the woman whispered,
with a frightened look at the broker.</p>

<p>"By thunder," exploded Murgatroyd, "I'll not stand
for this! Give that up, King, or I'll have the law on
you."</p>

<p>"The law won't touch me," said Matt. "This paper
was prepared by you for Mrs. Traquair to sign; as a
friend of Mrs. Traquair's I have the right to look the
trap over before you spring it."</p>

<p>"Well, of all the impudence&mdash;&mdash; Say, I wouldn't let
you fly that aëroplane for me if it never got a try-out
at Fort Totten. I'll be even with you for this, my lad!
I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd choked up with wrath and could not finish.
Meanwhile, Matt had glanced at the paper. One glance
was sufficient.</p>

<p>"This, Mrs. Traquair," said he, "is a document conveying
all your right, title, and interest in your late husband's
aëronautical inventions, and in the aëroplane now
in the post trader's store at Fort Totten, to Amos Murgatroyd.
And the consideration is three hundred dollars.
You will not sign it, of course?"</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?" faltered the woman hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Whatever you do, Mrs. Traquair, you must not sign
away your interest in what may perhaps prove valuable
property, for such a small sum."</p>

<p>Then Matt, with steady hands, ripped the document
into ribbons.</p>

<p>If Murgatroyd had been angry before, he was fairly
beside himself now.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you young scoundrel," he cried, shaking his
fist, "I'll teach you to meddle in my business affairs.
This isn't the last of this, not by a long chalk. I'll have
this woman and her brats out in the street before night.
I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll keep a respectful tongue between your teeth,
that's what you'll do," and Motor Matt stepped resolutely
toward the broker.</p>

<p>There was something in the lad's bearing that caused
Murgatroyd to grab his hat and retreat precipitately
to the door.</p>

<p>"You'll hear from me, the pair of you," he snarled,
"before you're many hours older."</p>

<p>Then the door slammed. Through the open window,
edged with its torn streamers of mosquito net, Matt
could see the broker hustling through the gate. A choking
sob struck on the lad's ears, and he whirled to find
Mrs. Traquair in a chair, her face in her hands.</p>

<p>There were ample evidences of poverty in the bare
little front room, and the appearance of the woman herself
testified eloquently of a fierce effort to keep the
wolf from the door by grinding toil. Matt's heart was
full of sympathy for her in her trouble.</p>

<p>"Don't take it so hard, Mrs. Traquair," said Matt,
stepping to her side. "There may be a way out of
this."</p>

<p>She lifted her head.</p>

<p>"No, there is no way out," she answered, in a stifled
voice, "you don't know Mr. Murgatroyd! You don't
know what it means to owe him money and not be able
to pay him even the interest."</p>

<p>"How much do you owe him?"</p>

<p>"Just a thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"But he said the interest due, if I recall his words,
was one hundred and fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;fifteen per cent."</p>

<p>"Fifteen per cent? Great spark-plugs! Why, that's
usury."</p>

<p>"Not out here. Harry borrowed the money on our
homestead, up in Wells County. He needed it to build
his aëroplane, and he needed a lot more that he raised
by selling his live stock and farming tools and some of
the furniture. He thought he'd get everything back
when he showed what the aëroplane could do, and sold
it to the government. But&mdash;but the very machine that
was to make our fortune has taken his life, and&mdash;and
what am I to do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Traquair's face went down into her reddened,
toil-worn hands again.</p>

<p>"There may be a way out of this, Mrs. Traquair," said
Matt. "It's clear, I think, that Murgatroyd is a thief
and a scoundrel. If he didn't believe there was merit
in your husband's invention he wouldn't be trying to
get hold of it. Have you any drawings, or papers from
the patent office, that I can look at to get an idea of
what the aëroplane is like?"</p>

<p>"There is a model&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good! A model will do better than anything else."</p>

<p>Mrs. Traquair went into another room and brought
out an old "telescope" grip. Unbuckling the straps with
fingers that still trembled, she lifted out of the grip and
held up for Matt's inspection the beautifully constructed
model of an aëroplane.</p>

<p>Matt sat down in a chair and took the model on his
knees. For all of ten minutes he studied the small machine,
his eyes glowing with amazement and delight.</p>

<p>"I haven't had much experience with aëroplanes," said
Matt finally, lifting his eyes to Mrs. Traquair's, "but
I've put in a good deal of time studying them. I came
to Jamestown in the hope that I could make a deal with
Murgatroyd and get a little practical work with a real
flying machine. When I first met Murgatroyd I didn't
understand the circumstance so well as I do now; and
after overhearing what I did while standing outside that
window, and after inspecting this model, I am more
anxious than ever to make an acquaintance with the
larger machine at Fort Totten. You haven't signed any
papers giving Murgatroyd a hold on that machine, have
you, Mrs. Traquair?"</p>

<p>"I haven't put my name to anything," declared the
woman. "Harry had arranged for the government
test, and had sent the machine to Fort Totten before
the&mdash;the accident. After that, Mr. Murgatroyd came
here and said he would have to take the aëroplane, and
get some one to fly it, unless I could pay him the interest
money. What could I do?" The poor woman made a
pathetic gesture with her hands. "There were the
funeral expenses to pay, and I could not even think of
paying the interest. Mr. Murgatroyd said that he would
try and find some one who was fool enough to risk his
neck in the aëroplane, and that if he could find such a
person he would talk with me again. That was the
reason he came here this morning."</p>

<p>Matt placed the model on the table, and walked
thoughtfully up and down the room.</p>

<p>"There are two or three ideas embodied in this aëroplane,
Mrs. Traquair," said he, halting in front of the
woman, "that seem to me to be of immense value. Do
you know whether Mr. Traquair protected the ideas with
patents?"</p>

<p>"Harry said that all his inventions were securely protected.
I can find the papers if you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your word is enough, for the present. A friend of
mine came to Jamestown with me, and we have a little
money which we would like to invest. Now, I will
make this proposition: If you will give me an order on
the post trader at Fort Totten for the aëroplane, I will
go to the fort at once and familiarize myself with the
machine; then, when the time for the government test
arrives, I'll put the aëroplane through its paces. If the
try-out is a success, then I and my friend are to have
half of the fifteen thousand dollars to be paid for the
machine. I will stand my own expenses, and, in addition,
will give you five hundred dollars. You can take
some of this money and pay Murgatroyd his interest;
then, if the trial at Totten is a success, you will have
plenty to take up the mortgage. Understand, I am not
buying an interest in the invention&mdash;that, I firmly believe,
is worth more than I could pay&mdash;but I am buying
a half interest in what the government is to hand over,
providing the government officials are pleased with the
performance of the aëroplane."</p>

<p>Mrs. Traquair was so overwhelmed she could hardly
speak.</p>

<p>"I don't want to rob you," she protested; "I don't want
to rob anybody, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt interrupted her with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I'm willing to take a chance, Mrs. Traquair," said
he. "If you will come to the Gladstone House at three
o'clock this afternoon, we'll have a lawyer draw up the
papers, and I'll give you your money. Can I take that
model with me to the hotel? I'm a stranger to you, so
I'll leave twenty dollars in place of the model."</p>

<p>"Who'll I ask for when I come to the hotel?" inquired
Mrs. Traquair.</p>

<p>This unexpected stroke of fortune seemed to have
dazed her. She had heard Murgatroyd call Matt by
name, but she did not appear to remember.</p>

<p>"Matt King," the young motorist answered.</p>

<p>A cry of astonishment fell from Mrs. Traquair's lips.</p>

<p>"I've heard my husband speak of you dozens of times!"
she exclaimed. "A friend of his, in Chicago, sent him
a newspaper clipping about you. Motor Matt is what
you were called in the newspaper article, and you had
a flying machine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A dirigible balloon, Mrs. Traquair," interrupted Matt.
"May I take the model?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," answered the woman eagerly, "do whatever
you please&mdash;I am sure Harry would have it so if
he could be here and speak for himself. Heaven is kind
to raise me up a friend like you, at such a time."</p>

<p>Hope glowed in Mrs. Traquair's face&mdash;for the first
time, it may be, since her husband's death&mdash;and Matt was
happy, for it was a pleasure to know that he was doing
some good in the world while helping himself.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, with the telescope grip in his
hand, he left the house and made his way swiftly in the
direction of the hotel.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MATT EXPLAINS TO M'GLORY.</p>


<p>Joe McGlory sat in front of the Gladstone House wondering
what had become of his pard. Matt had been
gone from the hotel for three hours, and when he left
he thought he would be back in an hour. Just as McGlory
had made up his mind to go bushwhacking around
the town, in the hope of picking up his pard's trail, the
king of the motor boys turned the corner, carrying a telescope
satchel, and walking rapidly.</p>

<p>"Thought you were lost, strayed, or stolen, Matt,"
sang out McGlory. "What have you got there?" he added,
his eyes on the grip.</p>

<p>"A flying machine," laughed Matt.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" gasped the cowboy. "Has
it come to this, pard, that every man can tote a flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
machine in his grip, then unpack, and hit a trail through
the clouds whenever he takes the blessed notion? Go on!"</p>

<p>"It's only a model," went on Matt. "Come up to our
room, and I'll tell you about it."</p>

<p>"Let's sit in at grub pile first. The dinner gong was
pounded half an hour ago, and I'm as hungry as a buck
Injun on a diet of cottonwood bark."</p>

<p>Matt took the satchel into the dining room with him,
and kept it between his feet all the while he was eating.</p>

<p>"You act like that thing was full of gold bricks," remarked
McGlory, as he and Matt climbed the stairs to
their room as soon as the meal was done.</p>

<p>"Not gold bricks," said Matt. "There's the biggest
little thing in this grip, Joe, you ever saw in your life."</p>

<p>"Have you hired out to that Murgatroyd person as
the human sky-rocket?" inquired McGlory, as he unlocked
and opened the door of the room.</p>

<p>"I'm going to try out an aëroplane, up at Fort Totten,
but not for Murgatroyd. A lot of things came up this
morning, and that's what took me so long. The only
way for you to get the whole business straight is for me
to begin at the beginning. Now sit down, take it easy,
and I'll tell you what I've found out, and what I've
done."</p>

<p>The cowboy was anxious to see what was in the
satchel, but Matt made no move to gratify his curiosity,
just then; instead, he launched into his experiences at
Murgatroyd's office, at City Park, and, lastly, at Mrs.
Traquair's. When he was through, McGlory rubbed
his eyes, stared, then rubbed his eyes and stared again.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"Dreamin'," answered the cowboy. "You're going to
take a little fly for fame and fortune, and I'm in on the
deal to the tune of two hundred and fifty cold plunks.
It's all right, pard. I'd buy an interest in the North Pole
if you thought there was any profit in icicles; but tell
me: Will it be pleasant for your Uncle Joe to stand
on the ground and watch you taking flyers in a thing
that killed one fellow, and is hungry to wipe out another?
Remember, I'm putting up two-fifty for the
privilege. It's all very fine to help out a poor widow
in distress, and to backcap a loan shark like Murgatroyd&mdash;that
reads like a book, and I'm plumb tickled to
help&mdash;but, son, there's your neck to think about."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to take any foolish chances, Joe," said
Matt earnestly. "I'm hungry to run an aëroplane with
a gas engine&mdash;and this aëroplane is the goods, don't forget
that."</p>

<p>"Um-m! Suppose you let me look at the goods?"</p>

<p>Matt unbuckled the straps, and lifted the model of
the aëroplane out of its case.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me about that!" jeered the cowboy. "Two
strips of cloth, one above the other, with an engine between
'em and a propeller behind! Fine! You'd look
pretty a mile high in that thing!"</p>

<p>"This," said Matt, taking the model on his knee, "is
the fruit of several hundred years of thought and study."</p>

<p>"Sufferin' buzzards! If I couldn't think up an arrangement
like that in two minutes, and make it in
three, I'm a Piute."</p>

<p>"When you understand it, Joe, you'll think differently.
An aëroplane is like a kite, but instead of a string
to pull it against the air, it has a propeller to push it.
It's easy enough to fly a kite, but when you put a man
in the kite, and a gas engine and other machinery, and
take away the string that connects the kite with the
earth, you're confronted with problems that it has taken
centuries to solve."</p>

<p>"Keno!" spoke up McGlory. "And do you mean to
say, Matt, that those two pieces of cloth have guessed
the riddle?"</p>

<p>"They'll come pretty close to it," asserted Matt. "The
thing that bothered, you see, was keeping the centre of
wind-pressure coincident with the centre of gravity so
the machine wouldn't turn turtle, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Help!" fluttered McGlory, throwing up his hands.</p>

<p>"A German named Lilienthal tried and failed, and so
did an Englishman named Pilcher. It remained for the
Wright brothers to work out the conundrum. Lilienthal
and Pilcher shifted weights to keep their machine
right side up in the air, but the American scientists shift
the ends of the wings, or planes. Traquair's invention
does away with the shifting of weights or planes. Look
here, Joe."</p>

<p>Matt pulled a diminutive lever affixed to a platform
in the middle of the lower plane. The ends of the left-hand
wings drew in, and the ends of the right-hand
wings simultaneously extended. By pulling the lever
the other way, a contrary movement was effected.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' blockheads!" muttered the cowboy, pushing
his fingers desperately through his thick hair. "I'm only
in the primer, pard, and you're leading me through the
hardest part of the fifth reader. Shucks!"</p>

<p>"You can understand, can't you," went on Matt patiently,
"that closing or opening the wings distributes
the air pressure on each side of the machine and holds
it level?"</p>

<p>"Never mind me, pard," said McGlory. "Keep right
on."</p>

<p>"These bicycle wheels," and Matt indicated three
wheels under the aëroplane, "give the machine its start."</p>

<p>"It's got to have a running start, eh?"</p>

<p>"Sure. When a bird begins to take wing it has to
have some kind of a start. A small bird jumps into
the air, and a big bird, like a condor, has to take a run
before its wings take a grip on the atmosphere. It's
the same with an aëroplane. A speed of twenty-eight
miles an hour is required before the air under the planes
will lift the flying machine. The motor of this machine
is geared to the bicycle wheels, at the start. When the
machine is running fast enough, the power is switched
to the propeller&mdash;and up we go!"</p>

<p>"Mebby we do," muttered the cowboy, "but I wouldn't
bet on it. Then, again, if we go up will we stay up?
And how can you guide the blooming thing skyward, or
on a level, or come down?"</p>

<p>"Why," continued Matt, "these two little planes in
front of the big ones attend to that." He shifted them
with a lever to show McGlory how they worked. "This
upright rudder behind," he added, "shifts the course to
right or left."</p>

<p>"I'll take your word for it, Matt," said the cowboy.
"I've taken a good many slim chances in my life, but
you'll never catch me taking a chance on one of those
things."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to ask you to take any chances, Joe,"
proceeded Matt. "All I want you to do is to trail
along and attend to the work below while I'm in the
air. Traquair has invented something here that's scientific
and valuable, and I'm sure we can make a winner
out of it, and not only help Mrs. Traquair, but ourselves,
as well. That work of ours in Madison netted us more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
than twelve hundred dollars. The question is, do you
want to put in two hundred and fifty dollars with me
on the chance of raking in seven thousand five hundred
up at Fort Totten?"</p>

<p>"You couldn't keep me from takin' that bet with a
shotgun," averred the cowboy. "If you're in on the
deal, then that means me, too, any old day you find in
the almanac. We'll go to Fort Totten, Matt, and while
you're paddlin' around in the air I'll hunt up soft places
for you to 'light. Your head's pretty level on most
things, and it's a cinch you must have this business figured
out pretty straight, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment, a hullaballoo came up from the street.
The room occupied by the boys was at the front of the
building, and the two windows were open.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' cats," cried McGlory, starting for one of
the windows, "I wonder if that's a fire? Ever since we
had that close call at the burnin' boathouse on Fourth
Lake, I'm scared of a fire."</p>

<p>But it wasn't a fire. A Chinese boy was rushing down
the street like a whirlwind, his silk blouse and baggy
trousers fluttering and snapping in the wind of his flight,
and his pigtail standing straight out behind him.</p>

<p>Back of the Chinaman came a bear. The bear was
muzzled, and there was a collar about its neck and some
six or eight feet of chain rattling around its legs. The
bear was going after the Chinaman like a brown streak,
and a whopping crowd of onlookers was gathering on
the sidewalks.</p>

<p>"Great jump sparks!" cried Matt, astounded; "Why,
it's Ping!"</p>

<p>"Ping it is, pard, and no mistake!" gasped McGlory;
"and we left Ping in Madison, workin' for Lorry. How
did he get here? And how in Sam Hill did that bear
pick up his trail?"</p>

<p>But Matt was already out of the room, and halfway
down the stairs on a run for the street.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">PING AND THE BEAR.</p>


<p>Ping Pong, the Chinese boy, had long ago made up
his mind that he was going to work for Motor Matt.
He wasn't particular whether he got any pay or not; just
so Matt gave him enough to do to keep him around.</p>

<p>Ping had followed Matt from San Francisco to Madison,
Wisconsin. When Matt was ready to leave Madison,
he got Ping a good job. The Chinaman seemed a
bit depressed, but he thanked Matt for the interest shown
in his welfare, and seemed reconciled with his lot when
he bade him good-by.</p>

<p>And now here was Ping, dropping into Jamestown
like lightning from a clear sky. The Chinese boy was
full of surprises, and his surprises were always dramatic&mdash;sometimes
tragic.</p>

<p>When Matt burst from the hotel into the street, Ping
was hustling for a telegraph pole. The bear was within
a couple of lengths of him, and there was nothing for
Ping to do but to find something he could climb.</p>

<p>Behind the bear raced a rough-looking man in a
buckskin jacket. He was flourishing his arms and yelling,
but the roar of the crowd prevented his words from
being heard.</p>

<p>The people on the sidewalks were enjoying the spectacle
immensely. The bear was muzzled, and the Chinaman
was scared. It did not seem possible that any
harm could come to the fleeing Celestial.</p>

<p>"Two to one on the bear!" whooped some one.</p>

<p>"It's the Chink gits my money!" guffawed some one
else. "He's goin' like a limited express train, an' that
telegraph pole's too handy."</p>

<p>The crowd surged into the street and toward the
pole. Ping was already climbing, but the pole was
slippery, and when he had got up about twelve feet, he
lost his "clinch" and slid downward. The bear was
standing erect and reaching upward with its front paws.
Ping slid down just far enough for the paws to reach
for him and close on one of his feet.</p>

<p>He gave a yell of fear, and once more began frantically
climbing. One of his wooden sandals was left
behind. The bear dropped it with a sniff, and once more
straightened up along the pole.</p>

<p>Again the slippery surface proved more than Ping
could manage, and down he came with a rush. The bear
got the other sandal before Ping could check his sliding,
and the crowd went wild with delight.</p>

<p>The man in the buckskin coat had come close to the
pole, but he made no move to interfere with proceedings.</p>

<p>Matt was not able to extract much fun from the situation.
The bear's claws were sharp, and if they once
came in contact with the Chinaman's body, the consequences
might prove serious.</p>

<p>Quickly as he could, Matt forced himself through the
edge of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Is that your bear?" he demanded of the man in the
buckskin coat.</p>

<p>"Waal," drawled the man, with a scowl, "I reckon it
ain't no one else's b'ar."</p>

<p>"Why don't you chase him away, then?" asked Matt
indignantly. "Do you want him to kill the Chinaman?"</p>

<p>"It won't be much loss if the critter takes a chunk
out o' him. He's only a Chink, anyways, an' he desarves
all he'll git."</p>

<p>This line of reasoning did not appeal to Matt. The
man was leaning on a heavy club. That club was the
only weapon handy, and Matt made a grab at it and
pulled it out of the man's hands. With his support thus
suddenly removed, the man fell flat in the street, striking
his head against the stone curb at the edge of the
walk.</p>

<p>No serious damage was done, and the man got up,
swearing luridly. Matt gave no further attention to him,
but turned toward the bear and Ping.</p>

<p>The Chinaman, tiring with his useless efforts, had
started for the third time to slide down the pole. Before
the bear could use its paws, Matt whirled the club and
struck the brute a heavy blow on the head. The bear
was dazed, and dropped down on all fours, blinking at
Matt.</p>

<p>Ping dropped to the foot of the pole, rolled off to one
side, bounded erect, and continued his flight down the
street.</p>

<p>Barely had Ping got away when Matt felt himself
grabbed from behind.</p>

<p>"I'll l'arn ye ter rough things up with me!" snarled
a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>Then, before Matt could make a move to defend himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
he was hurled backward so fiercely that he lost his
footing and fell sprawling in the dust.</p>

<p>The man, beside himself with rage, caught up the club,
which had fallen from Matt's hand, and would have
attacked the lad with it had McGlory not interfered.</p>

<p>While the club was still poised in the air, the cowboy
hurled a stone. The missile struck the man's arm, and
the uplifted hand fell as though paralyzed.</p>

<p>There was now another vent for the man's seething
anger. With a furious oath, he pushed his left hand
under his buckskin coat, and jerked a revolver from his
hip pocket. One of the bystanders caught the weapon
away from him.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a policeman showed himself,
stepping briskly between the man and McGlory.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble here?" asked the officer. "What
are you trying to do, Siwash Charley?"</p>

<p>"I'm er peaceable man," roared Siwash Charley, "but
I ain't a-goin' ter be tromped on!"</p>

<p>"Who's been tramping on you?" inquired the officer
soothingly.</p>

<p>"Fust off, it was er Chink. I was bringin' that tame
b'ar inter town fer delivery ter Hank Bostwick, at the
ginmill he runs, an' I sot down ter rest. I was ca'm,
an' the b'ar was ca'm, but erlong comes the Chink an'
sets off a big firecracker he had left over from the
Fourth, I reckon. Anyways, the blasted thing went off
like er cannon, an' I was blowed clean over the b'ar.
When I got up an' looked around, the b'ar was goin'
after the Chink, allymand-left an' all sashay. I took
arter the b'ar. Seein' as how Bostwick is goin' ter
gi'me twenty-five dollars for the brute, I wasn't wantin'
him ter git loose. When I got hyer, that feller"&mdash;Siwash
Charley nodded toward Matt&mdash;"pulled a stick I
was kerryin' out from under me. I sailed inter him an'
then that other feller"&mdash;he indicated McGlory&mdash;"let
loose with a rock an' purty nigh busted my arm. I ain't
goin' ter stand fer no sich doin's&mdash;that ain't Siwash
Charley's stripe, not noways."</p>

<p>"Did the Chink throw the firecracker in the first
place?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"He must er done it. If he hadn't, the b'ar wouldn't
have took arter him. I'll fix that Chink if I ever git
hands on him; an' I'll fix you fellers, too," he added,
scowling at Matt and McGlory.</p>

<p>"The Chinaman was trying to climb the telegraph
pole and get away from the bear, officer," spoke up
Matt, "but every now and then he'd slip down the pole,
and the bear would slap at him with his claws. Siwash
Charley, as you call him, stood by and never made a
move to interfere. I grabbed the club and struck the
bear, and the next thing I knew I was caught from behind
and thrown on my back."</p>

<p>"I'd 'a' welted you good, too," snarled Siwash Charley,
"if that rock hadn't landed on me."</p>

<p>The officer looked around. Three men had caught
the bear by the chain and were holding the brute warily.
The bear seemed to be recovering its good nature, the
Chinaman had escaped, and little damage had been done.</p>

<p>"Let the matter drop, Charley," said the officer. "You
haven't any proof that the Chink threw the cannon
cracker, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"B'ars hes got sense," blustered Siwash Charley, "an'
this un wouldn't hev chased the Chink if he wasn't
guilty."</p>

<p>"Well, you go on to Bostwick's and let the matter drop.
Scatter," the officer added sharply to the crowd, "the
fun's over with, and there's nothing more to see."</p>

<p>Matt beckoned to McGlory, and the two started back
toward the hotel. A roar from Siwash Charley caused
them to turn their heads.</p>

<p>"I'll saw off squar' with ye, yet," shouted Siwash Charley,
shaking his fist.</p>

<p>"Say moo and chase yourself!" taunted the cowboy.
"You're more kinds of a fake and false alarm than I
know how to lay tongue to."</p>

<p>The officer gave Siwash Charley a push in the direction
of his bear, and Matt caught his chum by the
arm and drew him into the hotel.</p>

<p>Annexing himself to the bear by means of the chain,
Siwash Charley shook his head angrily, rubbed his
forearm up and down the front of his buckskin coat,
and proceeded on toward Bostwick's.</p>

<p>When he got clear of the crowd, a man stepped out
into the street. It was Murgatroyd, and there was an
ominous gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I've got a job for you, Siwash," said the broker.</p>

<p>"Is thar any money in it, Murg?" demanded Siwash.
"It's got ter be spot cash an' good pickin's, er we don't
hitch."</p>

<p>"You'll get your pay before you begin. Come to my
office at five o'clock."</p>

<p>"I'll be thar," and the ruffian continued on toward
Bostwick's, still rubbing his aching forearm up and
down the front of his greasy buckskin coat.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd, muttering to himself, faded away into
the building known as Brown's block.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A NEW VENTURE.</p>


<p>"That old persimmon is about ripe enough to be
picked," growled McGlory, as he and Matt climbed the
stairs on their way back to their room. "He's one of
those cold game gents that gets quick and deadly every
time a fellow looks at him cross-eyed. The next time
he and I come together there's going to be fireworks."</p>

<p>"The chances are," said Matt, "we've seen the last of
him. We'll close up our business with Mrs. Traquair at
three o'clock, and then we'll catch the first train for
Totten. That will finish our dealings with Siwash
Charley, and with Murgatroyd, too, I hope. There's a
lot of work ahead of us during the next two weeks, and
we'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory were just turning from the hall
into their room. Some one had arrived in the room
during their absence. As fate would have it, it was
Ping.</p>

<p>The Chinaman sat in a rocking-chair near the window.
He was nervous and uncomfortable, not so much because
of his recent experience with the bear, perhaps,
as because he feared the sort of reception he was to
receive from Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"Well, if it ain't Little Bright-eyes himself!" grinned
McGlory. "You're more kinds of a surprise party, Ping,
than I know how to describe. What did you set off that
cannon cracker under the bear for?"</p>

<p>"My no shootee fi'clackel," expostulated Ping. "Melican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
boy shootee. Beal make one piecee mistake&mdash;chasee
Ping, no chasee Melican boy. Whoosh! No likee."</p>

<p>"Where did you come from, Ping?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Mad'son. My no workee fo' anybody but Motol
Matt. Tlakee tlain, come 'long."</p>

<p>"You didn't intend to stay in Madison any of the
time, did you?"</p>

<p>Ping shook his head.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me you were not going to stay
there?"</p>

<p>"Plaps, my tellee, you no likee. My makee wait till
come to Jimtown, then tellee. You no likee, no can send

<p>A crafty grin worked its way over Ping's yellow face.</p>

<p>"You can't shake him, pard," laughed McGlory.</p>

<p>"How did you know where we were coming?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"No savvy the pidgin. Come on same tlain."</p>

<p>"Then you got here on the same train we did?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Where have you been keeping yourself?"</p>

<p>"My stay by othel hotel. Bumby, thisee molnin',

<p>"What's the use of getting mad at you, Ping?" smiled
Matt.</p>

<p>The little Chinaman bounded joyfully out of his chair.</p>

<p>"My workee for you some mo'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You seem bound to work for me, whether I've got
anything for you to do, or not."</p>

<p>"My no havee luck 'less my workee fo' you. Plenty
queer pidgin. One piecee luck come plenty time when

<p>"We're going to hit the clouds on two canvas wings,
Ping," said McGlory.</p>

<p>"No savvy," returned Ping.</p>

<p>"Matt's going to fly. Savvy fly? All same bird," and
the cowboy flapped the edges of his coat, and lifted himself
on one foot.</p>

<p>"My no makee good bird," said Ping, the white running
into the yellow of his face. "My makee fall, bleakee
neck."</p>

<p>"You'll wish you'd stayed in Madison, Ping, before
you get through with this bag of tricks," went on McGlory,
winking at Matt. "We're going to let you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The cowboy was intending to have a little fun with
Ping, but, at that moment, a boy from the office appeared
in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Traquair is waiting for you down in the office,
Motor Matt," he announced.</p>

<p>"It's three o'clock!" exclaimed Matt. "Get your two
hundred and fifty, Joe, and come with me."</p>

<p>"I've got it, pard, right in my jeans," answered McGlory.</p>

<p>"You can stay here, Ping, till we come back," went
on Matt to the Chinaman.</p>

<p>"Can do," chirped Ping.</p>

<p>Thereupon Matt and McGlory went downstairs, and
the king of the motor boys introduced his friend to Mrs.
Traquair. The clerk directed them to a lawyer, and they
were soon in the lawyer's office, stating their business.</p>

<p>Mrs. Traquair had brought her husband's papers along
with her, and also a duplicate of the mortgage on the
Wells County homestead.</p>

<p>The lawyer's name was Matthews, and he was no
friend of Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>"Murg's a skinner," observed Matthews, "everybody
in these parts knows him for that. I'll bet he's been
planning all along to get his clutches on this invention
of your husband's, Mrs. Traquair. Motor Matt is doing
the handsome thing by you, I must say. He takes all
the risk, spends all his time and money, and then gets
nothing if the try-out at Fort Totten isn't a success.
Just sit down, please. I'll not be more than five minutes
drawing up a memorandum of agreement."</p>

<p>When the paper had been drawn up, signed, and witnessed,
and the money turned over, the only thing that
remained was for Mrs. Traquair to give the boys an
order on Benner, the post trader at Fort Totten, for the
aëroplane. This second paper having been written out
and signed, and the five hundred dollars turned over,
Matt and McGlory found themselves embarked on a new
venture.</p>

<p>It was different from anything Matt had yet undertaken.
Driving a dirigible balloon was utterly unlike
man&oelig;uvring an aëroplane. In a "dirigible" one had only
to sit calmly in the driver's seat, keep the motor going,
and attend to the steering. In an aëroplane, on the other
hand, there was a certain knack to be acquired. Air
pressure under the wings was never the same for two
consecutive moments, and if the swiftly changing centre
of air pressure was not met instantly by extending or
contracting the wings, disaster would be sure to result.
But Matt had studied the subject, felt sure that he could
acquire the necessary knack, and was determined to carry
the venture through to a success.</p>

<p>"You're a plucky young man," said Matthews to the
king of the motor boys when the business had been
finally wound up, "but I want to warn you to look out
for Murgatroyd. It does me good to hear how you
sailed into him, but that was something Murg will never
forget. As matters are now, you've beaten him, but he'll
never let it rest at that. He'll move heaven and earth to
get even with you. Keep your eyes skinned, that's all.
You're engaged in a worthy work, and I believe you'll
succeed, but you've got to be wary. I'm going with
Mrs. Traquair to pay this interest. Murg won't attempt
any bulldozing tactics while I'm around, you can depend
on that."</p>

<p>"You might see that he doesn't persecute Mrs. Traquair
while we're at Fort Totten, Mr. Matthews," said
Matt. "If he gets his interest, he can't make her any
trouble, can he?"</p>

<p>"He can't make her any more trouble until next year,
when the interest and principal both become due. Long
before that, I hope Mrs. Traquair will be able to settle
up with Murgatroyd in full. She can, too, if your
work at Totten is successful."</p>

<p>"How much do I owe you for drawing up these papers?"
Matt asked.</p>

<p>"Not a red!" was the prompt response. "Do you
think I don't know what you are trying to do for Mrs.
Traquair? And do you think I won't do as much as I
can to help her? Why, I got Harry Traquair's patents
through for him, and I'm proud to say that he was my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
friend. He knew Murgatroyd was a skinner, just as
well as I did, and at the time of his death he was exhausting
every effort to fit himself for making a 'go' of
that deal at Totten. He was planning on using that
money to get himself out of Murgatroyd's strangling
grip. It looks like a special favor of Providence, Motor
Matt, that you happened along here just when you
did."</p>

<p>Reference to her husband brought tears into Mrs.
Traquair's eyes. Stepping to Matt impulsively, she
caught one of his hands.</p>

<p>"I appreciate what you are doing, Motor Matt," said
she in a low tone, "and I thank you from the bottom
of my heart. I know the risks you are running, but
somehow I have the utmost confidence that you are going
to pass safely through them all, and please the officers
at Fort Totten."</p>

<p>Matt was touched by the poor woman's gratitude. He
pressed her hand cordially and reassuringly.</p>

<p>"I've gone into this thing to succeed, Mrs. Traquair,"
he answered, "and you may count on me to do my best."</p>

<p>"When do you go North?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"We can't go before morning. The afternoon passenger
has left, and we'll have to take the 'accommodation'
at eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"Well, good-by, and good luck. If I can ever do
anything for you here, in a legal way, don't hesitate to
call on me."</p>

<p>Matthews gripped the young motorist's hand heartily,
and the little party separated, the lawyer and Mrs. Traquair
starting for Murgatroyd's office, while Matt and
McGlory made their way back to the Gladstone House.</p>

<p>"Little as I know about flyin'," remarked McGlory,
"and scary as I am about letting you go up in that aëroplane
of Traquair's, just the same I feel like patting
myself on the back. It's a brand-new venture, pard, but
it's a good one. There's something in it, you see, besides
just helping ourselves."</p>

<p>"It's not going to be easy," remarked Matt.</p>

<p>"That's you! Sure, it ain't going to be easy, hitting
up a cloud trail and sliding around through the air in a
machine that's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't mean that," interrupted Matt. "During the
last hour or so I've had a hunch that Murgatroyd is
going to get busy."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that old hardshell," declared the cowboy,
with confidence, "if you do the rest of the work with
that sky-scraper. That's what I'm along for, savvy?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A PARTNER IN VILLAINY.</p>


<p>Murgatroyd's interview with Matthews and Mrs. Traquair,
at the time the one hundred and fifty dollars interest
was paid, threw the broker into a spasm of chagrin
and temper. One would have thought that Murgatroyd
would have been delighted to get his interest money.
But it was not the interest that Murgatroyd wanted, so
much as financial embarrassment on the part of Mrs.
Traquair, which would ultimately lead to foreclosure
of the mortgage on the Wells County homestead.</p>

<p>To Motor Matt the broker rightly attributed the
widow's ability to pay the interest. And if Motor Matt
had given Mrs. Traquair the interest money, it was a
foregone conclusion that Matt had interested himself in
the aëroplane at Fort Totten.</p>

<p>Matt, the wrathful broker reasoned, was to fly the
aëroplane at the forthcoming government trial. If he
pleased the government, and the machine was bought,
then Mrs. Traquair would be able to take up the mortgage.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd paced his office for a long time after
Matthews and Mrs. Traquair left. In the midst of his
reflections, Prebbles thrust his head in at the door.</p>

<p>"A caller, sir," he announced.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" demanded Murgatroyd sharply.</p>

<p>"Siwash Charley."</p>

<p>A feeling of gratification swept through the broker's
nerves.</p>

<p>"Send him in here. And, I say, Prebbles, you can
put on your hat and coat and go home. You're quitting
an hour earlier than usual, but you can make it up some
other day."</p>

<p>Precious few holidays old Prebbles got without "making
them up."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," he said in his usual humble fashion,
and faded into the other room.</p>

<p>A moment later Siwash Charley faced the broker.</p>

<p>"Shut the door, Siwash," said Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>"That looks like we was a-goin' ter talk over things
that was mighty important," said Siwash Charley as he
closed the door.</p>

<p>"We are."</p>

<p>"You're an ole fox, all right," chuckled the other;
"reg'lar ole gouger. Money layin' around ev'rywheres,"
Siwash added, his eyes on the desk where the money
paid by Mrs. Traquair had been left.</p>

<p>"There's a hundred and fifty in that pile, Siwash,"
said Murgatroyd. "If you agree to help me, I'll give
you that; and, if you carry out the work successfully,
I'm going to give you a hundred and fifty more."</p>

<p>Siwash Charley's eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>"Must be somethin' mighty tough on ter make ye
loosen up like that," said he. "Mebby it's so tough I
won't dast ter touch it."</p>

<p>"I guess it's not too tough for you," returned Murgatroyd
dryly.</p>

<p>"I've done a heap o' things fer you, Murg, as won't
bear the searchin' light o' day," observed Siwash Charley.
"From now on, though, I'm a-goin' ter be a leetle
keerful."</p>

<p>"If you don't want the job," rapped out the broker,
"say so, and I'll get somebody else."</p>

<p>"How kin I tell whether I want it or not till ye explain
what the work is?"</p>

<p>"I'll not go into details until you agree to take hold.
I'd be in a nice fix, wouldn't I, if I told you what was
up, and then had you back out on the proposition."</p>

<p>"Ye'll have ter tell me somethin' about it, that's shore."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you this much, Siwash, and that is that the
two young fellows you mixed up with, when the bear
treed the Chinaman, are the ones you'll have to go after.
That ought to be enough, hadn't it?"</p>

<p>Charley's eyes kindled viciously.</p>

<p>"I'm arter them two," he growled.</p>

<p>"Of course you are," went on the broker, noting with
satisfaction the effect his words had had on his caller.
"You're pretty well acquainted up around Devil's Lake,
aren't you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"I spent a good many years thar, Murg."</p>

<p>"Do you know Benner, the post trader?"</p>

<p>"Him an' me uster be blanket mates."</p>

<p>"Well, this young fellow who roughed things up with
you, is called Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"That's his name, hey? I'm going ter saw off squar'
with this Motor Matt. Revenge is the sort o' por'us
plaster I put on my grudges ter draw out the pizen. I'm
wuss ner a rattler's bite when I land on a feller, Murg."</p>

<p>"There's a flying machine in the post trader's store at
Fort Totten. Traquair sent it up there for a government
trial, two weeks from to-day."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"This Motor Matt knows something about gas engines
and flying machines, and I'm pretty sure he's going to
Totten on the train to-morrow morning to familiarize
himself with the Traquair flying machine, and try it out
for the government when the time comes."</p>

<p>"Then I kin lay fer him around Totten, hey?"</p>

<p>"Not alone, Siwash."</p>

<p>The burly ruffian gave a grunt of disgust.</p>

<p>"Think I kain't handle that outfit alone, Murg? Oh,
thunder! Why, them two fellers ain't much more'n
kids. I kin pick 'em up, one in each hand, an' knock
their heads tergether."</p>

<p>"Don't be overconfident, Siwash. If you are, it'll
lose the game for us. You ought to have two more men
associated with you&mdash;fellows you can depend on. You
can either get them at Totten, or here in Jimtown."</p>

<p>"Who'll pay 'em?" asked Siwash cautiously.</p>

<p>"I'll give them twenty-five dollars each, if the work
succeeds."</p>

<p>"That brings us down ter the work ag'in," said Siwash.
"What is it, Murg?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want the flying machine tried out for
the benefit of the government. I want something to
happen so that this Motor Matt won't be able to give a
demonstration of what the aëroplane can do."</p>

<p>"Got er axe ter grind, hey?"</p>

<p>"That part of the game is my business, Siwash, not
yours," said the broker sharply. "The point is, do you
want to follow out my plans, and make the money I'm
offering you?"</p>

<p>"I'm hungry fer money, all right, Murg," ruminated
Siwash. "I jest sold that pet b'ar ter Bostwick fer
twenty-five&mdash;b'ar that I captered as a cub an' fetched up
by hand. But twenty-five won't last me fer long. If I
kin git three hundred off'n you it'll be quite a boost. Still,
fer all that, I'd about made up my mind ter be honest
from now on, an' cut out these hyer crooked deals. The
way ye come at me, though, kinder sets me ter calculatin'
that I'll go inter pardnership with ye fer one more
round, an' then start ter bein' honest arter that."</p>

<p>Siwash Charley pushed up the right sleeve of his
buckskin coat, unwrapped a reddened bandage, and exhibited
a ragged wound.</p>

<p>"This hyer's what makes me listen ter ye, Murg," he
gritted. "It ain't the three hundred dollars so much as
this hyer arm. That's whar the young cub landed on
me with the stone. I kain't never pass that up without
sawin' off squar'."</p>

<p>"Of course you can't," declared Murgatroyd, doing
everything in his power to foster Siwash Charley's hard
feelings, "it wouldn't be like you to forget a thing
like that, Siwash. I guess you haven't weakened to
that extent."</p>

<p>Siwash Charley swore under his breath, replaced the
bandage, and pulled down the sleeve of his coat.</p>

<p>"Will you help me?" went on the broker. "I've got
to have your promise, before I can tell you the plan I've
thought out."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll help you," answered the ruffian.</p>

<p>"And you know of two trustworthy men you can get
to go with you?"</p>

<p>"I could pick up a dozen game fellers right here in
this man's town all inside o' fifteen minutes. They're
fellers, mind ye, who'd run the risk o' puttin' their necks
in a noose fer twenty-five plunks."</p>

<p>"Those are the men we want. You're not to tell them
anything about me, mind."</p>

<p>"That's allers yer game, Murg," and something like
discontent pulsed in Siwash Charley's hoarse voice; "ye
don't seem ter hev the sand ter stand up an' face the
music."</p>

<p>"I can't afford to. How long do you think my loan
business would last if I was found out in a job like
this? You've got to screen me, Siwash."</p>

<p>"I'll promise ter do that, an' I ain't goin' ter let no
one find out that I'm mixed up in it, either, if I kin
help. Go ahead."</p>

<p>The broker got up, and moved softly to the door.
Opening it quickly he peered into the outer office. Apparently
satisfied, he closed the door again, and returned
to his chair.</p>

<p>"Walls have ears," he remarked with a grim smile.
"Draw your chair closer, Siwash."</p>

<p>The other, with another of his ill-omened chuckles,
pulled his seat nearer to Murgatroyd; then, for five minutes,
Siwash listened while the broker spoke in low,
quick tones. When Murgatroyd was done, Siwash
leaned back with an exultant expression on his face.</p>

<p>"By Jericho," he exclaimed, "we kin do it, Murg!
Thar'll be no flyin' at the fort two weeks from terday.
This Motor Matt kain't git ter Totten afore termorrer.
If ye'll start me an' them other two fellers in a ottermobill,
an' land us at Totten afore mornin', I'll agree
ter take keer o' the flyin' machine. If I kain't do that,
then I'll agree ter take keer o' Motor Matt. Count on
me, Murg."</p>

<p>"Enough said, then," answered Murgatroyd, getting
up. "Take your money, Siwash, and get out of here.
It won't do for us to be seen leaving Brown block together.
You go out first, and I'll follow, a little later.
The automobile will be at the place I told you within
an hour, and a trusty man will be along to drive it."</p>

<p>Two minutes later, Siwash Charley swaggered out of
the entrance to the office building and slouched off toward
a "shady" part of the town.</p>

<p>Five minutes after Siwash left, Murgatroyd emerged.</p>

<p>The broker was hardly out of sight, before Prebbles
glided out of the Brown block, his face puckered with
fear and apprehension. But there was resolution in the
clerk's face, too, and he made his way in the direction
of the Gladstone House.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MATT SHIFTS HIS PLANS.</p>


<p>Matt, McGlory, and Ping had their supper together.
Following supper, Ping went back to the other hotel
where he had been staying, for the purpose of getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
his luggage. The luggage was not extensive, being
completely wrapped in a yellow silk handkerchief, knotted
at the corners. There was a pair of grass sandals
in the handkerchief bundle, and the Chinaman stood in
need of new footgear.</p>

<p>When Ping had gone, Matt and McGlory sat out in
front of the hotel, waiting for early bedtime to roll
around. While they sat there, a stoop-shouldered, wizened
figure shambled along the walk.</p>

<p>"Prebbles!" exclaimed Matt.</p>

<p>"Not so loud," croaked Prebbles. "Come along&mdash;drop
in behind&mdash;don't let anybody notice."</p>

<p>Matt was surprised.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" queried McGlory.</p>

<p>"A clerk in Murgatroyd's office," whispered Matt, getting
up.</p>

<p>"Look out for him, then, for he may be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's all right," cut in Matt. "Come along, Joe.
Prebbles has something on his mind."</p>

<p>Deferring to Matt's better judgment, McGlory arose,
and he and Matt followed Prebbles around one corner
of the hotel, and into the dusky regions that lay in the
vicinity of the rear of the building.</p>

<p>Here, in a place where they could talk unheard by
outsiders, Prebbles halted.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Prebbles?" queried Matt, as he
and McGlory drew close.</p>

<p>"Who's that with you?" asked Prebbles guardedly.</p>

<p>"A friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Is he the one that hit Siwash Charley with the stone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All right, then. I got to be careful. If I'm not,
Murg'll find out about this and pull the pin on me. I
get eight dollars a week workin' for him, and I can't
afford to lose it. Eight dollars a week pays my board,
takes care of my laundry bills, buys a <i>War Cry</i>, and
gives a little to the army every week. You boys belong?"</p>

<p>"Belong to what, Prebbles?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"To the Salvation Army," answered Prebbles earnestly.</p>

<p>"No," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"I do. Soon's I leave here, and get my supper, I'm
going to the barracks, get into my uniform, take my
tambourine and march with the rest. I was converted
two weeks ago. That's why I hate Murgatroyd and
his ways. He's a robber. I want to do right, and
that's why I'm here."</p>

<p>"What do you work for the old skinflint for, if you
want to do right?" put in McGlory.</p>

<p>"There's nothing wrong with tainted money," replied
Prebbles, "if you use it in the right way."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think your employer would like to have
you in the army," said Matt.</p>

<p>"He likes it. You see, he thinks it gives the office
a standing which it hasn't got, me being connected with
the army. But little he knows what I'm doing on the
side. It's because I belong, Motor Matt, that I spoke
to you as I did when you left the office this forenoon;
it's because of that, too, that I suspected something was
up when Siwash Charley came into the office at close to
five o'clock and Murg told me to take my hat and coat
and go home; and it's because of that that I'm here,
now, to give you a warning."</p>

<p>McGlory gave vent to a low whistle.</p>

<p>"Looks like Siwash and Murg were stackin' up against
us, pard," said he.</p>

<p>"Does Siwash Charley know Murgatroyd?" inquired
Matt.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say," breathed Prebbles. "Siwash is
a hard citizen, and used to live by gambling, stealing,
and other ways that the law wouldn't sanction if he
was found out. He's a hard case, Siwash is&mdash;most as
hard a case as Murg. I didn't leave the office when I
was told to go. I put on my hat and coat, walked real
heavy to the door, slammed it, and then slipped back to
a curtain that hides a lot of old letter files. Back of the
curtain there's a stovepipe hole from the outside room
into Murg's. I climbed up on the letter files and listened
at that hole. Wouldn't have done it if I didn't belong.
Say," and Prebbles straightened himself with feeble
pride, "it makes a regular lion of a man to join the
army. You ought to be in; you don't know what you're
missin'."</p>

<p>"The army's a good thing, Prebbles," said Matt, "and
I'm glad you belong to it. Siwash and Murgatroyd
talked about me?"</p>

<p>"Did they?" echoed Prebbles. "Well, they didn't talk
about anything else. You see, Murg has got a mortgage
on the Traquair homestead, up in Wells County,
and he wants to get the quarter section on the mortgage.
I don't know why, but he's set, and determined to foreclose
and annex the land. That's what he's workin' for.
Everything was coming his way, Motor Matt, till you
blew in and befriended Mrs. Traquair. Now Murg's
afraid you'll win that government money and fix things
so'st Mrs. Traquair can pay off the mortgage. Murg's
goin' to fight you, and he's rung in Siwash and two of
Siwash's friends to help him."</p>

<p>"Speak to me about this!" murmured McGlory. "That
hunch of yours, Matt, is panning out good color already."</p>

<p>"How is he going to fight us, Prebbles?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"By fixing things so'st you can't exhibit the flying
machine at the time set. If it ain't exhibited then, the
government'll back out. In case Siwash and his pals
can't spoil the machine, then their orders are to eliminate
Motor Matt. Oh, it's a villainous scheme, I tell
you that."</p>

<p>"I guess we can take care of ourselves, Prebbles,"
averred Matt. "The first train for Totten leaves in the
morning, and we're going up on that. Siwash and his
pals can't get there ahead of us, and we'll be able to
look after the aëroplane and see that nothing goes wrong
with it."</p>

<p>"That's where you're lame," fluttered Prebbles. "Siwash
and his pals have already started for Totten."</p>

<p>"Started!" exclaimed Matt. "How?"</p>

<p>"Automobile. That gang of scoundrels will get to
Totten in time to carry out Murg's villainous plans to-night.
I've wasted an hour tellin' you this, waitin' for
you to get through supper. You see, I couldn't walk
into the hotel and talk to you; everybody would have
seen me, and told Murg about it. Then Murg would
have pulled the pin on me."</p>

<p>"What are Siwash and his friends going to do at
Totten?" queried Matt, more wrought up over the information
of Prebbles than he cared to admit.</p>

<p>"I don't know that, Motor Matt. When they talked
over that part of it, they dropped their voices so low I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
couldn't hear. But you can bet it's a slick scheme, if
Murg had anything to do with it."</p>

<p>"Sufferin' slow freights!" murmured McGlory. "It
looks as though Murg had knocked us out of the running
right at the start off."</p>

<p>"Prebbles," said Matt, "do you know of any one,
here in town, who has a good automobile we could
hire?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's a fellow named Black, a real estate man,
who has a car. In spite of his name, he's as white a
man as you'll find in a month of Sundays. Real estate's
kinder dull, just now, and I know he sometimes lets out
his car."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"I pass his place on the way to my boarding house. If
you want, I'll have him come around and see you."</p>

<p>"There's not much time to lose, Prebbles, as Siwash
and his pals are already on the road. Call me up on
the phone and let me know if he'll take us to Fort Totten
to-night. If he will, have him hustle his car right around
to the hotel."</p>

<p>"He'll ask a heap of money for the trip," suggested
Prebbles. "How much are you willing to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell him we'll give him fifty dollars if he'll get us
to Fort Totten before morning."</p>

<p>"That'll fetch him! I guess I better start right off.
You won't tell anybody about me giving Murg away
to you? I don't want to have Murg pull the pin, you
understand."</p>

<p>"Certainly we won't tell anybody!" answered Matt.
"We're obliged to you, Prebbles, and here's a five-dollar
bill to pay you for your trouble."</p>

<p>Prebbles drew back from the money.</p>

<p>"You can't make me take that," he declared. "Murg's
the only robber in the loan office. I'd be as bad as him if
I took the money. I'm doing this because I want to be
square. They'd kick me out of the army if I took
money for doin' what's right."</p>

<p>"Take this," insisted Matt, "and give it to the mission.
You can do that, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure." Prebbles pocketed the money. "I'm off,
now," he went on, starting away. "I hope you won't
have more trouble than you can take care of, but you've
got a hard gang against you. Good-by."</p>

<p>"So long, Prebbles."</p>

<p>The clerk vanished, and Matt and McGlory, their
nerves tingling with the prospect ahead of them, went
back into the hotel, and took chairs near the telephone
booth.</p>

<p>Mr. Black himself called up, fifteen minutes later. He
was willing to take the boys to Fort Totten that night,
for the sum of fifty dollars; his machine was ready, and
he'd be at the hotel in five minutes.</p>

<p>"Bully!" exulted McGlory, when Matt came out of
the booth and reported what the real estate man had
said. "Say, pard," the cowboy added, "you're throwin'
your money around like a nabob. At this rate, how
long'll that stake last that you picked up in Madison?"</p>

<p>"Till we pull down that government money on account
of the aëroplane, Joe," returned Matt decisively.</p>

<p>"You're banking on that?"</p>

<p>"To the last cent. I'll soon be on the wing, Joe, and
making a fight for fame and fortune. That's got to be
a winning fight, in spite of Siwash Charley and his pals,
and in spite of Murgatroyd."</p>

<p>Matt's quiet confidence always inspired confidence in
others.</p>

<p>"Whoop!" jubilated McGlory. "You've got a cheery
way about you, pard, that's as catchin' as the measles.
Sure we'll win; and we'll save the old homestead for
Mrs. Traquair like the feller in the play."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DODGING TROUBLE.</p>


<p>The wagon road from Jamestown to Devil's Lake
follows the railroad all the way. At Minnewaukon, near
the western end of the lake, the wagon road to Fort
Totten leaves the iron rails and points southeast.</p>

<p>The trail from Jamestown to Minnewaukon crosses
a prairie almost as level as a floor, and the trail itself is
like asphalt. From Minnewaukon southeast, the road is
not so well traveled. Formerly the mail was hauled
from Minnewaukon to the post by wagon, but the mail
carrier was put out of business by a launch that crossed
the lake from Devil's Lake City, on the north shore.
The garrison at the fort, too, has dwindled to a corporal's
guard, so that the post has become practically
abandoned.</p>

<p>Black's car was not a late model. It had the obsolete
rear-entrance tonneau, and was equipped with a four-cylinder
thirty-horse-power motor. However, the car
could "go." It would have been a poor car, indeed, which
could not show its heels on such a road.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock when Matt, McGlory, Ping, and
Black ducked out of Jimtown, and struck into the trail
that followed the railroad track and the river. Black
attended to the driving, and Matt occupied the seat at
his side. McGlory and Ping occupied the tonneau.</p>

<p>Matt explained to Black that there was a car, somewhere
ahead, which they wanted to beat to the post
trader's store at Fort Totten; also, that the car ahead
was filled with men who were not on friendly terms
with Matt and his companions.</p>

<p>Black was a man of spirit.</p>

<p>"You want to pass that car, then," said he, "and you
want to dodge trouble?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," agreed Matt. "We don't want to butt into
any trouble if we can help it. A whole lot depends upon
our getting to the post trader's store right side up with
care, and ahead of the other outfit."</p>

<p>"We'll do what we can," and Black nursed the car to
its best speed.</p>

<p>The night was cool, the sky was cloudless, and the
two acetylene lamps burned holes in the dark far in advance
of the car as it devoured the miles. The forward
rush, and the motor's music, thrilled Matt as they always
did whenever he was connected with a speeding
engine.</p>

<p>They whipped through a little town, hardly glimpsing
the scattered lights before they had left them astern.</p>

<p>"This machine is a back number," remarked Black,
"but she can slide along pretty well, for all that."</p>

<p>"You're right," said Matt. "I never saw a car with
a rear door that could hold a candle to this one. But the
road helps. It's like a boulevard."</p>

<p>"Take these Dakota roads, when they're neither too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
wet nor too dry, and they're hard to beat. We're going
to lose time, though, going around the sloughs."</p>

<p>"Sloughs?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Just bog holes," went on Black. "They gully the
prairie, here and there, have no inlet or outlet, and the
water rises and falls in 'em like tides of the ocean.
Queer, and I don't think the rise and fall have ever
been explained. A wagon with high wheels can spraddle
through, but low wheels and a lot of weight have to go
round. But the car ahead will have to go around, too.
There's one of the sloughs, just ahead. We'll begin
going around it right here."</p>

<p>Having been for several years in the real estate business,
selling farms up and down the Jim River, Black
had an accurate knowledge of the country.</p>

<p>Three extra miles were added to the journey by going
around the slough north of Parkhurst. But this was a
whole lot better than taking a chance and miring down.</p>

<p>"Did you know Harry Traquair, Mr. Black?" Matt
asked, when they were once more in the road and forging
ahead.</p>

<p>"I did," answered Black, "and he was one of the finest
fellows you ever met. Still, for all that, I thought he
was a little bit 'cracked' on the flying-machine question.
He was always of an inventive turn, and he built his
first aëroplane in his head, up on his farm in Wells
County, long before he ever came to Jimtown and built
one of canvas, and spruce, and wire guys. The Traquairs
have had pretty hard sledding for the last three
years. Mrs. Traquair had all the faith in the world in
her husband, but she was possessed with the idea that
some accident was going to happen to him, and she was
never around when he flew the aëroplane. Too bad
Harry Traquair had to be killed just as he was about
to give his machine the first government test."</p>

<p>"That's the way luck runs, sometimes," said Matt.
"What town's that?" he added, as they whisked through
another cluster of lights.</p>

<p>"Buchanan," answered Black. "Say, but we're coming!
The next place is Pingree, then Edmunds, then
Melville. After Melville we'll swoop into Carrington,
the biggest town between Jamestown and the lake. Here's
where I'm going to hit 'er up for the last ounce of power
in her cylinders. Hold on to your teeth, everybody!"</p>

<p>More gasoline and a faster spark hurled the car onward
in a way that made Ping chatter and hang to the
rail behind the front seats.</p>

<p>Then something went wrong. The motor began to
miss fire, the speed slackened, and the motor died with a
gasping splutter.</p>

<p>"Oh, hang the luck!" growled Black, getting down.</p>

<p>While Matt kept hands off, Black tried out the primary
circuit, then the secondary, then the buzzer. After that
he cranked and cranked, but nothing happened except a
distressing cough when the engine tried to start.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that knock you slabsided?" growled Black.
"I guess I'll have to take the carburetor to pieces, run
pins through the spray nozzle and sandpaper the float
guides. If that don't work, I'll go under the car and
take off the fuel pipe, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a gravity feed, isn't it?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, don't lose any time on the carburetor, just
yet."</p>

<p>Matt got at the gasoline tank. What he did Black
couldn't see, but he wasn't more than a minute doing it.</p>

<p>"Now turn over your engine," said Matt, as he climbed
back into his seat.</p>

<p>Black gave the crank a pull, and the pleasant chug
in the explosion chamber came to his ears.</p>

<p>"What the dickens did you do?" he asked, dropping
in behind the steering wheel and getting the car under
way.</p>

<p>"The tank vent was clogged," explained Matt. "You
can't feed by gravity if the gasoline tank is hermetically
sealed."</p>

<p>"That's right; but how did you know the vent was
plugged?"</p>

<p>"By the noise."</p>

<p>Black turned this over in his mind as they rushed
onward.</p>

<p>"I guess you know a thing or two about motors," he
remarked. "I never heard of a fellow who could tell
the tank was hermetically sealed merely by the noise of
the engine."</p>

<p>"It takes practice," said Matt, "that's all."</p>

<p>Pingree, Edmunds, and Melville were passed in record
time, and the car rushed into Carrington at a quarter
to ten. Carrington was quite a town, and the party
halted to make some inquiries about the car that was
preceding them.</p>

<p>From a man at one of the hotels they learned that a
car had stopped at a filling station, about nine o'clock,
and had dashed on to the northward about nine-fifteen.
There were four men in the car, and one of them was
Siwash Charley.</p>

<p>Siwash Charley seemed to be well known through that
section, and the fact that the man at the hotel knew him
made Matt and his friends certain that their enemies
were less than an hour ahead.</p>

<p>"We're gaining on 'em!" cried McGlory, as the car
shot through the outskirts of Carrington. "If we can
keep on gaining, we'll reach the post trader's with
ground to spare."</p>

<p>"We're good for it," averred Black. "Hold onto your
hair and eyebrows."</p>

<p>The air fairly sang in the ears of the boys as the real
estate man, throwing himself spiritedly into the contest,
hurled his machine onward over the hard roadbed.</p>

<p>They flashed through a couple of towns which, Black
said, were Divide and Sheyenne.</p>

<p>"The next place," the real estate man went on, "is
Oberon. After that comes Lallie, and then Minnewaukon.
But it's a waste of time to go to Minnewaukon.
If we went there, we'd have to come southeast to Totten.
We can leave the road at Lallie and go northeast
to Totten, thus saving a few miles and considerable
time. If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off with a startled exclamation. Then, in a
twinkling, it was out clutch, down brake, and a kick at
the switch.</p>

<p>Another car, at a dead stop in the road ahead, had
come like a blot under the glow of their lamps.</p>

<p>At that point the prairie was level, and no such thing
as fences were to be seen.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' hold-ups!" exclaimed McGlory. "Something's
gone wrong with the Siwash outfit. Look! Two
of the gang are plugging this way."</p>

<p>The cowboy had "called the turn." Two dark forms
untangled themselves from the dusky blot in the road
which represented the car, and were running back along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the trail. As the figures came closer, it could be seen
that they were carrying rifles.</p>

<p>"Quick!" hissed Matt in Black's ear. "Go around
the car&mdash;take to the prairie. We can make it if there's
gas enough in the cylinders to take the spark."</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the engine took the spark and
Black worked the car rapidly out of the road, heading
so as to give the other car a wide berth.</p>

<p>The dry grass crunched under the swiftly moving tires,
and the car leaped away as Black coaxed her to do her
best.</p>

<p>"Halt!" shouted a husky voice; "halt, or we'll put a
bullet into you!"</p>

<p>"Drop down!" ordered Matt; "they're going to shoot."</p>

<p>"Let 'em shoot," said Black pluckily. "It's pretty
dark for accurate firing, and we'll be out of range in a
minute. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sping! Sping!</p>

<p>Two reports came from behind, two flashes leaped
from the guns, and two bullets fanned the air close to
the occupants of the car.</p>

<p>But the car dashed on over the rolling turf, and presently
regained the road, once more, well in advance of
the other automobile.</p>

<p>"I guess that's dodging trouble, all right!" muttered
Black, with a grim laugh.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BLANKED.</p>


<p>Only two shots were fired. Before the two scoundrels
in the road could send any more bullets after Matt and
his friends, their car had swept back into the road and
the other automobile acted as a barricade.</p>

<p>"Siwash must have known who we were," remarked
McGlory. "How do you reckon he found that out?"</p>

<p>"The way we kept on going when he ordered us to
halt was enough for him," said Matt.</p>

<p>"I'll bet it was a surprise," chuckled McGlory. "Wish
I could be close to Murg when he hears about it. We're
in the lead, now, and I hope we can keep it."</p>

<p>"If the motor hangs together," returned Black, "we'll
not only keep it, but increase it. That's a murderous
gang, back there," he added. "There must be something
mighty important awaiting you fellows at the post trader's
to cause Siwash Charley to break loose like that!"</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd is back of it," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd? There's a double-dyed scoundrel, if I
ever knew one."</p>

<p>Black's expressing himself in this manner opened the
way for Matt to tell him the true inwardness of that
night's work.</p>

<p>"You're the sort of fellows I like to help!" cried
Black, as soon as Matt had placed the situation before
him. "It's a fine thing for Mrs. Traquair, and it speaks
mighty well for you that you've jumped into this thing
like you've done. Not many young fellows would have
gone to all that trouble, with the prospect of a broken
neck, or a bullet between the ribs as a possible reward.
But let me tell you something, Motor Matt."</p>

<p>Black spoke very earnestly, and commanded the instant
attention of the king of the motor boys.</p>

<p>"What's that, Mr. Black?"</p>

<p>"If I were you, I'd be more afraid of that aëroplane
than of Siwash Charley or Murgatroyd."</p>

<p>"Flying the aëroplane is the least of my worries. I'm
sure I can handle it all right."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure. Traquair invented the machine,
and it stands to reason that he knew it as well as any
human being could; but see what happened! Something
snapped, a gust of wind hit the aëroplane, and the whole
business came down like a piece of lead."</p>

<p>"Accidents are always liable to happen, of course,"
said Matt; "the only thing to do is to guard against
them as well as you can, and do your best."</p>

<p>"This North Dakota wind is a hard thing to figure
on," pursued Black. "It gathers terrific force coming
across the prairies, and it's liable to come up quick. I
don't think Traquair's aëroplane could stand a sixty-mile-an-hour
wind."</p>

<p>"She couldn't make any headway against it, but I
believe she could be kept upright."</p>

<p>"That's your look out, Motor Matt, and I don't want
to throw any wet blanket on your hopes. Be careful,
that's all, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Black broke off with an angry exclamation. The motor
began to miss fire, and finally came to a stop.</p>

<p>Matt, his head inclined, had been listening sharply.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" asked Black, getting out.</p>

<p>"It's the carburetor, now," said Matt. "Sounds to
me as though it was clogged."</p>

<p>The carburetor was taken apart and freed of the obstruction
that kept the gasoline out of the mixing chamber.</p>

<p>A delay of half an hour was caused, and while they
were at a halt an anxious look out was kept along the
road, behind. Much to the relief of the boys and the
real estate man, the other car failed to put in an appearance.</p>

<p>"They must be hung up with something serious," observed
Black, as he once more started the car in the
direction of Lallie.</p>

<p>"It can't be too serious to suit me," laughed McGlory.
"I won't make any kick if they're kept back there on
the road for a week."</p>

<p>"No such luck as that, Joe," said Matt.</p>

<p>Black was about to say something more when the motor
went wrong again. It began to pound furiously.</p>

<p>Black's exasperation reached a point where he was
tempted to say things. Matt, however, laughed at his
impatience, and proceeded to right the trouble, warning
his friends to keep a sharp look along the back track
while he was doing it.</p>

<p>There was an hour's delay, this time, but still the other
car did not show up, and Matt and his companions finally
continued on their way, congratulating themselves that
they were still in the lead.</p>

<p>Not much time was spent in Lallie. The town was
dark, and all the inhabitants had undoubtedly been abed
and asleep for several hours.</p>

<p>Matt looked at his watch just as they were bumping
over the railroad tracks into the northeast road that led
to Totten.</p>

<p>"Two o'clock," announced Matt.</p>

<p>Black groaned.</p>

<p>"Elegant time we're making," said he, "but we'll be
at the post trader's by three o'clock, providing we don't
have any more breakdowns."</p>

<p>This road was not nearly so good as the one they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
had been following, mainly because it was not so well
traveled. Not more than fifteen miles an hour could be
made.</p>

<p>"There's another road to Totten from Oberon," observed
Black. "That road comes into this one about five
miles this side of Totten. We'll soon be at the forks,
now. I didn't suggest taking the Oberon road, because
it's a good deal worse than the one we're following."</p>

<p>When they were close to the forks, the creak of a
wagon reached their ears, and the gas lamps showed
them a loaded vehicle just pulling into the Oberon road.
This was the first team they had met since leaving
Jamestown.</p>

<p>"Say, there!" yelled a man on the wagon. "Slow up
a little with that chug cart o' yourn, will ye? My
hosses ain't used ter sich sights."</p>

<p>Black lessened the speed and came on more slowly.
The wagon was at a standstill, and the horses were
snorting and rearing against the pole. The car got
past without causing an accident, however, and, a little
after three, drew up in front of the post trader's store.</p>

<p>The store was at the foot of a hill which overlooked
the lake, and was surrounded by the fort. As was to be
expected, the store was dark, and seemed deserted.</p>

<p>"Benner lives in the back part," said Black. "Go
around the side of the building, Matt, and knock on the
door. You'll not be long getting him up. I'll wait here
till I see what luck you have, and then I'll put up the
car and bunk down somewhere for the rest of the night."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory jumped out of their seats and followed
around the plank wall of the building. Although
it was dark as Egypt in the shadow of the wall, yet they
succeeded in locating the door, and pounded a loud summons
on its panels.</p>

<p>The post trader was a sound sleeper, and it took three
or four minutes to develop any signs of life within the
dark store building.</p>

<p>At last, however, they could hear some one stirring
around. A light appeared in a window, and a shuffling
step was heard approaching the door.</p>

<p>"If you're Injuns," cried an angry voice, "get out!
You can come after what you want in the mornin'."</p>

<p>"We're not Indians," said Matt. "Are you Mr. Benner?"</p>

<p>"That's my name, yes."</p>

<p>"Then we've got important business with you. Please
open the door."</p>

<p>"Beats all a feller can't have no sleep," grumbled Mr.
Benner, shoving a bolt and jerking the door open.</p>

<p>A big, sandy-haired man, in undershirt and trousers,
stood confronting the boys, a flickering candle upheld in
his right hand.</p>

<p>"What d'ye want?" demanded Benner.</p>

<p>"Here's a paper I want you to read," answered Matt,
taking from his pocket Mrs. Traquair's order for the
aëroplane, and handing it to the post trader.</p>

<p>Benner grabbed the paper in his left hand, and held
the candle in front of it.</p>

<p>"Jumpin' Mariar!" he gasped. "Here's an order for
that bloomin' flyin' machine."</p>

<p>"Yes. We're here to take charge of it, Mr. Benner."</p>

<p>"Oh, y' are, eh? Well, I haven't got it. Looks kinder
suspicious, too, this here order does."</p>

<p>"Haven't got it?" repeated Matt, staring at McGlory.</p>

<p>"Ain't I tellin' ye?" answered Benner in an irritated
tone.</p>

<p>"Did some men come here in an automobile, a little
while ago, and take it away?"</p>

<p>"Any one would have played hob takin' that flyin' machine
away in an automobile," scowled Benner. "There's
somethin' mighty queer about this. Step inside, you
two, an' I'll show you that telegram."</p>

<p>Intensely disappointed, the two boys stepped into the
room. Benner placed the candle on the table, and picked
up a yellow sheet, which he handed to Matt.</p>

<p>"That come to the fort, about two hours ago, an' the
leftenant sent it down ter me," explained Benner. "I
had to hustle some, but I worked through the trick. Now,
less'n an hour after I get to bed, here you fellers come
askin' for the flyin' machine. That's more'n I kin understand,
that is."</p>

<p>The telegram read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Send flying machine on the jump to Oberon. Get it
off within an hour after you receive this. Will settle for
your trouble with the man who brings it."</p></blockquote>

<p>This message was addressed to the post trader, at Fort
Totten; had been sent from Oberon, and was signed by
"Mrs. Traquair."</p>

<p>"Oh, sufferin' dummies!" cried McGlory. "Blanked,
or I'm a Piute!"</p>

<p>Matt was fully as much wrought up as was his chum.</p>

<p>"This message is a forgery, Mr. Benner!" he cried.
"Mrs. Traquair isn't in Oberon, and she never sent it."</p>

<p>"How was I ter know that?" snorted the post trader.
"Soon's I got the message, I routed out my man, Jake,
an' we hitched up to the wagon, loaded on that consarned
machine that I've been holdin here, an' Jake
started with it fer Oberon."</p>

<p>The cowboy gave a groan, and fell over against the
wall.</p>

<p>"That must have been him we passed, Matt," he murmured.</p>

<p>Without pausing to reply, Matt whirled and ran out
of the room. The aëroplane was on the road to Oberon,
but the automobile could easily overtake the wagon. It
was well, however, not to lose any time.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SIWASH SHOWS HIS TEETH&mdash;AND HIS HEELS.</p>


<p>Black's astonishment was great when Motor Matt reappeared
at the front of the building and leaped into
the car.</p>

<p>"Hustle for the Oberon road, Mr. Black!" Matt cried.</p>

<p>"What's to pay?" asked Black as McGlory flung himself
into the tonneau.</p>

<p>"You remember that wagon we passed?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Of course, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, the aëroplane is aboard the wagon."</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar!" Black was already on the ground,
cranking up. "How did that happen?" he asked, getting
back into the car and turning it the other way.</p>

<p>When they were well started, Matt explained about
the telegram received by the post trader.</p>

<p>"It's easy to understand what happened," said Matt.
"Murgatroyd's plan was to send Siwash Charley here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
after the aëroplane. If Siwash had had all night and
part of to-morrow to work in, he and his pals would
have got away with the flying machine in spite of us.
But Siwash had to make another move when he saw
us on the road. It was a clever move, too, although it
only won out by a scratch. Siwash went on to Oberon
and sent that message, signing Mrs. Traquair's name
to it. If we hadn't had so many breakdowns, we'd
have reached the post trader's before his man got away
with the aëroplane."</p>

<p>"Well," declared Black, "we can overhaul the wagon
long before it gets to Oberon. If Siwash Charley had
used his head a little more, he'd have known there
wasn't one chance in ten of this move of his succeeding.</p>

<p>"And to think of us sailin' right past that wagon,"
muttered McGlory, "and even slowing up so as not to
scare the horses! Funny how things will turn out
sometimes."</p>

<p>The Chinese boy had been using his eyes and ears a
great deal more than his tongue. But his emotions, at
every stage of that ride from Jamestown, had changed
with Matt's and McGlory's. Now Ping was all chagrin,
and a wild desire to "push on the reins" and overhaul
Jake.</p>

<p>The road was fairly good until the automobile reached
the forks; after that, it ran into hilly country where there
was considerable sand.</p>

<p>Black forced the car all he could, but the poor speed
it developed filled the impatient boys with dismay and
anxiety.</p>

<p>"We'll never overtake that wagon in a thousand years,
at this gait," fumed McGlory.</p>

<p>"You forget, Joe," answered Matt, "that if we're going
slow, the wagon is going a lot slower."</p>

<p>"That's the talk," said Black. "We'll come up with
the wagon several miles this side of Oberon."</p>

<p>As the car ground through the sand, and chugged up
the hills, the boys kept a sharp watch ahead. Dawn
brightened in the east, and the gray streamers crept
steadily toward the zenith.</p>

<p>"Five o'clock," said Matt, looking at his watch. "The
sun will be up in half an hour."</p>

<p>"Precious little I care for that," chuckled Black.
"There's Jake!"</p>

<p>The car had topped a hill which gave its passengers a
long view out over the level prairie. Far away in the
distance the dim gray light showed the boys a dark blot
on the plain. It was impossible to tell much about the
blot, at that range, but there could be no doubt concerning
it. Surely it was the wagon; it could be nothing
else.</p>

<p>"Jake must have punctured a tire," observed McGlory
humorously. "What has he stopped for?"</p>

<p>"Possibly he stopped to breathe his horses," suggested
Black. "We'll eat up the ground, now, for the road is
on the level, and there's less sand."</p>

<p>Black let the car out. As he and the boys came
closer and closer, a startling scene slowly unfolded before
their eyes.</p>

<p>The wagon was at a standstill, just as the cowboy
had said, and beside it was a motor car. Four or five
figures could be seen moving around in the vicinity of
the wagon. Abruptly these figures hunched together,
and stood quietly.</p>

<p>"It's the other automobile," said Black between his
teeth. "Siwash Charley and his pals came out from
Oberon to meet Jake."</p>

<p>"They've got together and are looking this way,"
breathed McGlory.</p>

<p>"Mebbyso they makee shoot," chattered Ping.</p>

<p>"Shall we go on?" queried Black. "It's for you to
say, Motor Matt. I don't think Siwash will dare rough
things up so close to the fort, and in broad day."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Matt grimly, "we've got to go on. For
all we know, Murgatroyd may have told Siwash to destroy
the aëroplane. In fact, that may be what he's
doing, now. Go on, Mr. Black, and go with a rush."</p>

<p>The boys fell silent as the car bounded on along the
road. All of them felt the danger of their position,
but neither McGlory, Black, nor Ping would have thought
of asking Matt to turn back.</p>

<p>In a few moments the boys were so close they could
see the guns which Siwash Charley and his friends were
holding in their hands. Matt, however, had more concern
for the bulky load in the wagon than for the guns.
So far as he could see, the load was intact, and had not
been tampered with.</p>

<p>The wagon was facing toward Oberon, and the car&mdash;drawn
up alongside the wagon&mdash;was pointed toward Fort
Totten. Several yards in front of the car stood Siwash
Charley, and two other men, who looked fully as villainous.
All of these three had rifles.</p>

<p>Jake was standing up in the front part of the wagon,
hanging to the reins with one hand and looking back.
The driver of the automobile was leaning against the
front of the car, watching passively for what was to
come. An atmosphere of ugly foreboding hovered over
the scene as Black stopped his car within a dozen yards
of Siwash Charley and his two pals.</p>

<p>"That's erbout as fur as we reckoned we'd let ye
come," shouted Siwash Charley. "If ye'd got hyer
ten minutes later, ye'd hev found the flyin' machine scattered
all over the perary."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," cried Matt, standing up in the
car, "that you were going to wreck the aëroplane?"</p>

<p>"That's what," answered Siwash Charley, "an' we're
goin' ter do it, yet. Ye needn't think that yer comin'
will make any diff'rence. I told you cubs I'd git even
with ye fer what ye done, but when I showed my teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
ye didn't allow I'd bite. I'm showin' my fangs ag'in,
an' this time thar's goin' ter be somethin' doin'."</p>

<p>"Siwash Charley," said Matt, "you don't mean to say
that a trifling disagreement, like the one we had in
Jamestown, is enough to make you destroy that aëroplane?"</p>

<p>"I reckon ye don't know me, Motor Matt," blustered
Siwash. "I allers make it a p'int ter saw off even, an' I
reckon I kin squar' my account with you a heap better
by bustin' up the flyin' machine than in any other way.
I'll give ye two minutes ter turn that thar machine o'
yourn and take the back track."</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the words, Siwash lifted his rifle
to his shoulder, and pointed it directly at Matt.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys did not stir, but his gray
eyes snapped dangerously as they looked into the eyes
gleaming along the barrel of the gun.</p>

<p>"You're not going to do any more shooting, Siwash
Charley," said Matt, his voice steady. "You took two
shots at us last night, and if either one of them had
struck me, or any of my friends, you and Murgatroyd
would have paid dearly for it."</p>

<p>The mention of Murgatroyd caused Siwash to drop
his gun suddenly.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd hasn't got a thing ter do with this," he
roared. "It's my own affair I'm settlin'."</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd has got everything to do with this!"
retorted Matt. "He got that car for you, and sent you
out of Jamestown last night. You hoped to reach the
fort ahead of us&mdash;and you'd certainly have done so if
we'd waited until this morning and taken the train. If
you make any trouble for me here, Murgatroyd will be
arrested in Jamestown just as quick as a message can
be wired to the police. And you'll make trouble for
yourself, too, for you played a trick in getting that aëroplane
off the government reservation. You can show
your teeth as much as you please, but if you try to bite
you'll regret it."</p>

<p>"I'm done chinnin' with you!" whopped Siwash Charley,
once more bringing his gun to his shoulder. "Turn
that ottermobill t'other way, an' hike out o' this. Ye
got a minute left."</p>

<p>Black got out of the machine, and walked around to
the crank.</p>

<p>"Leave the crank alone, Black," ordered Matt. "That
scoundrel's a coward, and he doesn't dare to shoot."</p>

<p>Black hesitated.</p>

<p>"Better do as he says, pard," observed McGlory,
climbing over the back of the seat and ranging himself
shoulder to shoulder with Matt.</p>

<p>The cowboy's words were addressed to Black. The
latter retreated from the front of the machine, and
stood at the roadside, watching developments anxiously.</p>

<p>It was a situation of the gravest peril, but Matt
could not go away and leave the aëroplane to be wrecked.</p>

<p>"Are ye goin'?" yelled Siwash furiously. "If ye think
I dasn't shoot, I'll show ye I ain't afeared o' nothin'."</p>

<p>"Put down that gun!" ordered Matt.</p>

<p>The scoundrel's finger flexed on the trigger. In another
instant the trigger would have been pressed. But
something happened. Jake, standing in the front of the
wagon, whirled a long blacksnake whip about his head
by the lash. Suddenly he let it go, and the weighted
handle shot through the air, and struck Siwash Charley's
fated right arm. The end of the whip handle landed
at about the place where McGlory's missile had struck,
the day before.</p>

<p>With a swirling bellow of pain, Siwash dropped the
rifle and staggered back, clasping his right forearm
with his left hand.</p>

<p>He swore terribly, but the torrent of profanity was
cut short by one of his pals.</p>

<p>"Sojers!" cried the man, sweeping Siwash Charley's
gun off the ground. "Hustle out o' this, or we're done
fer!"</p>

<p>"Swatties!" jubilated McGlory, waving his hat. "Speak
to me about this!"</p>

<p>Matt faced the other way. There, sure enough, were
half a dozen mounted troopers galloping toward the
scene.</p>

<p>The pop of the other car's motor could be heard, and
when Matt looked around, once more, Siwash Charley
and his comrades were kicking up the dust in the direction
of Oberon.</p>

<p>"Siwash Charley showed his teeth," laughed Black, immensely
relieved, "and now he's showing his heels.
Motor Matt," he added soberly, "I wouldn't have been
in your shoes, a moment ago, for all the money in the
United States Treasury!"</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys did not hear the last remark.
He had leaped down from the car, and had run
forward to the wagon, where he was reaching up and
shaking hands with Jake.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">"UNCLE SAM" TAKES HOLD.</p>


<p>"Them fellers stopped me," said Jake, "an' was allowin'
to unload the flyin' machine. What could I do
agin' the lot of 'em, and armed like they was? But the
fust I knowed they intended ter smash the thing was
when Siwash begun talkin' with you. He'd have shot
ye, too. I know him, an' I know he's desprit, so I took
a chanst with the blacksnake. Gosh-all-hemlocks, but I
shore made a good throw of it."</p>

<p>"You certainly did," said Matt, "and I'm much obliged
to you."</p>

<p>Matt turned away from the wagon to talk with the
officer in charge of the troopers. The soldiers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
come to a halt, and one of them, in the uniform of a
lieutenant, had spurred forward.</p>

<p>"What's the ruction here?" he demanded. "Benner
rushed up to the fort and said some one had stolen the
Traquair aëroplane. He showed us a telegram he had
received, told us he had started Jake for Oberon with
the machine, and that a couple of young fellows had
happened along, pronounced the telegram a forgery, and
had started in pursuit of Jake in an automobile. Are
you one of the lot that chased up Jake?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Matt. "Harry Traquair was killed in
Jamestown&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's stale news," interrupted the lieutenant, sitting
back in his saddle and taking Matt's sizing at his leisure.</p>

<p>"Well," went on the king of the motor boys, "I've
come to Totten to try out the aëroplane for the government."</p>

<p>"You?" The lieutenant laughed. "Why, my lad, the
machine will do for you just as it did for Traquair. Who
are you?"</p>

<p>"Matt King."</p>

<p>The lieutenant almost fell out of his saddle.</p>

<p>"Not Motor Matt?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm called more often than anything
else."</p>

<p>"Well, this certainly takes the cake!" muttered the
lieutenant, pulling at his mustache. "My name's Cameron,
and I'm a lieutenant in the signal corps. By a
coincidence, I'm here to watch the trials of the aëroplane
for the government."</p>

<p>"Where does the coincidence come in, lieutenant?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Do you remember a young fellow called Ensign
Glennie?"</p>

<p>"Remember Glennie?" cried Matt. "Well, I guess I
do. Why, he went around South America with me in
a submarine."</p>

<p>"Representing the government, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, Glennie's my cousin, and he wrote me all about
you and that trip in the submarine. So that's where
the coincidence comes in. He watched your work with
the submarine for the government, just as I'm to watch
your work with the aëroplane. Give us your hand, Motor
Matt! I feel as though we were old friends."</p>

<p>Matt was delighted. It was one of those meetings
which sometimes happen, and which make a fellow overjoyed
with the occasional workings of fate. McGlory,
Black, and Ping were introduced, and then Matt took the
lieutenant off by himself and narrated the events that
had taken place, and which had led up to the villainous
work of Siwash Charley.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cameron was properly indignant.</p>

<p>"Siwash Charley's a whelp," he averred, "and this
Murgatroyd is a thoroughbred scoundrel. But the aëroplane
seems to be safe, and you'll have no further trouble
with those villains. From this on, Motor Matt, you
and your friends and the Traquair aëroplane are under
the protecting wing of Uncle Sam. We'll have the flying
machine guarded, and you and your friends will stay
at the fort with us. There's only a handful of boys at
Totten, now, but we're more than enough to look after
Siwash Charley."</p>

<p>The lieutenant rode over to the wagon.</p>

<p>"Jake," said he, "you'd better drive back with that
machine."</p>

<p>"That's what I was calculatin'," grinned Jake. "Somebody
hand up my whip."</p>

<p>McGlory gathered in the blacksnake, and tossed it to
the teamster.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," called the lieutenant to one of the troopers,
"you and the rest will convoy the aëroplane back to
Totten. If Siwash Charley or any of his gang show up,
shoot them on sight."</p>

<p>"All roight, sor," answered the sergeant, touching his
cap.</p>

<p>"Ride back with us in the car, lieutenant," suggested
Matt. "One of the troopers can bring in your horse."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Cameron promptly.</p>

<p>He dismounted at once, and turned his horse over to
the Irish sergeant. He and Matt rode in the tonneau,
with Ping, where they could talk to better advantage,
and McGlory mounted to the front seat alongside of
Black.</p>

<p>"My orders instructed me to be of all the assistance
I could to Traquair," remarked Cameron, when they
were sliding off toward the hills on the return trip; "so,
of course, now that you represent the Traquair interests,
I consider it my duty to help you."</p>

<p>"Glad of that, lieutenant," responded Matt. "After I
get the aëroplane together I'll not need much help. You
see, I've got to learn to run the machine. There's a
knack I've got to get hold of."</p>

<p>"You'll get hold of it, never fear. A fellow like you
can learn whatever he sets out to."</p>

<p>"But I've only got two weeks," laughed Matt, "and
there's a fair chance, according to a good many people, of
breaking my neck."</p>

<p>"That's what I was thinking, when I heard Traquair
had been killed, and that there was an advertisement in
the newspapers for a man of nerve. But, somehow, I
feel pretty confident of the outcome, now that I know
you are to boss the air flights. Let's see. I think Glennie
wrote me you had had some experience with a
dirigible balloon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I served my apprenticeship at that sort of flying
before I tied up with the submarine."</p>

<p>"Then you can't be called a new hand at the game."</p>

<p>"Sailing a dirigible balloon is a whole lot different
from driving an aëroplane."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Learn it well, Motor Matt, whatever you do. According
to conditions governing the aëroplane trial,
you've got to stay in the air two hours, make not less
than thirty miles an hour, and carry a passenger. I'm
to be the passenger."</p>

<p>So long as Matt had only his neck to think about, the
situation was tolerably clear; but, now that he knew he
had to carry the lieutenant along, he began to worry a
little.</p>

<p>"I didn't know that part of it before," said Matt
gravely.</p>

<p>"Don't fret, pard," put in McGlory, turning around
in his seat. "If the lieutenant hasn't got the nerve, why,
I'll go with you. And I reckon you know about how
much I enjoy the prospect of flyin'."</p>

<p>"You can't cut me out of that, McGlory," declared
Cameron. "Why, if Mrs. Traquair hadn't found some
one to navigate the aëroplane, I was thinking seriously
of offering to do it myself. I was attached to the balloon
corps, for a while, but I'm handicapped by a very
imperfect knowledge of gas engines. You're the fellow
for the job, all right, Matt, and you can bet something
that I'll not pass up the chance of flying with you. Know
anything about the Traquair aëroplane?"</p>

<p>"Only what I've found out from a study of the model.
Apart from that, I've been looking into the subject of
aëroplanes for some time. It was the hope of adding to
my knowledge of the subject that brought me to North
Dakota."</p>

<p>"And you dropped into a villainous conspiracy right
at the start off!" exclaimed Cameron. "I'll send a message
to Oberon, just as soon as we reach the post, and
see if Siwash Charley and his mates can be headed off."</p>

<p>"It won't do any good to send a message, lieutenant,"
said Matt. "Siwash knows enough to make himself
scarce. Better let the matter drop&mdash;for the present, anyhow."</p>

<p>"But there's Murgatroyd. He's got himself into a
pretty kettle of fish. You can go after <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"I don't want to bother with him, nor with any one
nor anything else but the aëroplane for the next two
weeks."</p>

<p>"I guess your head's level on that point," mused Cameron.
"However, if Siwash Charley shows up on the
reservation while you're at work, we'll lay him by the
heels and throw him into the guardhouse. When are
you going to put the aëroplane together?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon," replied Matt. "There's no time to
lose."</p>

<p>An hour later they were at the post. Black had made
up his mind to remain over until the following day, and
Matt paid him his fifty dollars, and thanked him for
his work with the motor car.</p>

<p>Following a late breakfast at the post, Matt went down
to meet Jake and superintend the unloading of the aëroplane.
Selecting a favorable site for the experiments
with the aëroplane required time, and dinner was ready
at the post before Matt and Cameron had picked out a
spot which they considered most favorable for the initial
trials.</p>

<p>Following dinner, Matt and McGlory, in their working
togs, and accompanied by the lieutenant, hustled down
the hill to begin work with the aëroplane.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ON THE WING.</p>


<p>The ground Matt selected for his initial experiments
lay about a quarter of a mile from the post trader's
store on the road toward Lallie, Minnewaukon, and
Oberon. For a long distance, at this place, the road was
level, flat as a board, and smooth as asphalt. It was
just the right bottom to give the aëroplane a good start
on the bicycle wheels.</p>

<p>This part of the road, too, was free from timber, so
there could be no accidents from collisions with stationary
objects.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cameron had a large "A" tent brought
down from the post, and pitched in a place convenient
to Matt's field of operations. Here the young motorist
and his assistants could rest, when they so desired, and
make their headquarters at all times.</p>

<p>Four dismounted cavalrymen were to be constantly
on guard, each detail relieving the other, morning and
night.</p>

<p>The post farrier placed his working tools at Matt's
disposal, and hammers, hatchets, and wrenches were
carried down to "Camp Traquair," as the aëroplane headquarters
came to be called, and Matt set actively to work
uncrating the machine.</p>

<p>The two big planes of the flying machine measured
thirty-two feet in length by five in width. For convenience
in packing, carrying, and stowing, these planes
had been cut into halves, one half dovetailing into the
other by means of iron sockets.</p>

<p>In assembling the aëroplane, Matt worked from memory
alone&mdash;his study of the model serving him in good
stead.</p>

<p>Both of the thirty-two-foot planes were put together
first, and then joined, in a double-deck arrangement, by
tough spruce rods, which held the planes six feet apart.
The rods were further braced by wire guys, which could
be tightened at will by means of turn-buckles.</p>

<p>For a width of about five feet the middle section of
the lower plane was reënforced with light, tough boards.
This platform formed a bed for the engine, the gasoline
tank, the mechanism-operating propeller and bicycle
wheels, and afforded seats for the operator and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
passenger, as well as giving a rigid support for the
various levers controlling motor and rudders.</p>

<p>The sliding wing extensions, so necessary for keeping
the machine's equilibrium while in the air, gave Matt
the most trouble of all. They slid on ball bearings from
under each plane, and were so adjusted that when one
extended the other contracted in the same proportion;
for, if there was too much air pressure under one wing,
it was necessary that the area of that wing should be
reduced, while the area of the other was enlarged.</p>

<p>The putting together of the two large planes consumed
the afternoon; and when Matt, weary and tired,
answered the mess call of the colored cook sent down
from the post, he was able to see that the aëroplane was
gradually taking shape.</p>

<p>"Looks about as much like a bird as I do," commented
McGlory.</p>

<p>The next morning Matt went to work on the two
smaller planes which, in flight, went ahead of the machine,
guiding up or down, and doing something toward
distributing the air pressure. The vertical plane, which
had its place in the rear, was likewise adjusted.</p>

<p>So rapidly did the work proceed that, by noon, Matt
was ready to install the motor.</p>

<p>Traquair, it was evident, had built the aëroplane, put
it together, and adjusted every part before shipping it to
Fort Totten. The result of this forethought was apparent
in the installing of the engine. Every piece had
its place and dropped into it readily. The exact point
for every bolt and screw was marked.</p>

<p>By seven o'clock the second night the aëroplane was
ready.</p>

<p>McGlory, just before he, Matt, and Ping went for their
belated supper, stood in front of the forward planes.</p>

<p>"Every boat, pard," said he, "whether she sails the
ocean or the sky, has got to have a name; therefore I,
by virtue of my authority as assistant to the big high
boy who is to navigate the craft, name this aëroplane
the <i>June Bug</i>."</p>

<p>With that, the cowboy broke a bottle of Adam's ale
over the lower plane.</p>

<p>"No likee <i>June Bug</i>," chattered Ping. "Him velly
bum name. Why you no callee him <i>Fan Tan</i>, huh?"</p>

<p>"<i>Fan Tan!</i>" jeered McGlory. "Why, you squint-eyed
heathen, this ship's no gamble, but a sure thing. Remember
the lines of that beautiful poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The June bug has no wings at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it gets there just the same."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"That's good enough," laughed Matt. "I'm going
to eat and turn in, for to-morrow I fly."</p>

<p>The motor was a four-cylinder, and Matt judged, after
taking measurements, that it would develop about twenty-five
horse power.</p>

<p>The next day came on with a very high wind, so high
that Matt deemed it worse than foolish to attempt his
first flight. It was hoped that, later in the day, the wind
would go down. Time was not lost while waiting, however.
Gasoline was secured from the fort, together with
a quantity of oil, and the motor was disconnected and
given its own particular try-out.</p>

<p>It worked splendidly.</p>

<p>Next the power was connected with the bicycle wheels,
and the <i>June Bug</i> was sent along the road under its own
power. Matt, in the driver's seat, came very near taking
a fly in spite of himself, for the wings caught the wind
and lifted the aëroplane some four feet in the air. With
a twist of the lever, Matt quickly pointed the smaller
planes downward, and glided into the road again without
a jar.</p>

<p>The wind held until nightfall, and, of course, all hope
of a fly for that day went down with the sun.</p>

<p>On the following morning there was hardly a breath
of air stirring. All the troopers came down from the
fort, and every person from the immediate vicinity of
the trader's store assembled to see how well Matt would
acquit himself of his first attempt at flight in an aëroplane.</p>

<p>After making sure that everything was properly adjusted
and in perfect working order, Matt had the <i>June
Bug</i> pushed to the centre of the hard road. McGlory
was stationed at one wing, and Lieutenant Cameron at
the other, in order to run with the machine and help give
it a start.</p>

<p>"Nervous, Matt?" queried Cameron, as the king of the
motor boys took his place on the seat and lifted his
feet to the foot rest.</p>

<p>"Not half so nervous as you are, old chap," smiled
Matt. "Here, feel my pulse."</p>

<p>"I'll take your word for it. Don't go very high."</p>

<p>"So far as results are concerned, if I'm going to
fall it might just as well be from five hundred feet as
from fifty. All ready?"</p>

<p>"All ready!"</p>

<p>McGlory's voice was a bit husky, for he was even more
nervous than Cameron.</p>

<p>The engine was already humming like a swarm of
bees.</p>

<p>"Let her go," said Matt, switching the power into the
bicycle wheels.</p>

<p>In less than a dozen feet, the aëroplane was traveling
too fast for Cameron and McGlory, and they dropped
out. Standing breathless where the <i>June Bug</i> had left
them, they watched the machine rush faster and faster
along the road, then, suddenly, swing into the air and
glide upward.</p>

<p>Cheers rang out from half a hundred throats, only
to be suddenly stifled as the great wings tilted, fifty
feet above ground, into an almost vertical position. Matt,
they could see, was almost hurled from his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>A groan was wrenched from Cameron's lips, and he
turned away.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' thunderbolts, but that was close!" the lieutenant
heard McGlory mutter, and then the cheering was
renewed.</p>

<p>Cameron looked again. The <i>June Bug</i> had righted
herself, and was rushing off toward the lake, mounting
steadily, higher and higher.</p>

<p>"That feller's head's level, all right," remarked Benner.</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Cameron.</p>

<p>"Why," laughed the post trader, "if he takes a tumble
he intends comin' down in the water."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it!" cried McGlory. "He don't
intend to take a tumble. That pard of mine has his
head with him, at every stage of the game."</p>

<p>At the watchers judged, the <i>June Bug</i> passed over the
post some two hundred feet in the air. The contortions
of the machine were alarming. First one side would
tilt, and then the other. Half a dozen times it looked
as though the <i>June Bug</i> must surely go over on its back,
and come down a wreck with her intrepid young driver
mangled in the machinery.</p>

<p>But Motor Matt, calm and clear brained, was working
to "get the knack." Every second he was studying.
Not once did thoughts of a mishap flash through his
brain.</p>

<p>At the end of ten minutes he returned from the lake,
glided downward, and brought the bicycle wheels to a
rest in the road within a hundred feet of the place from
which he had started.</p>

<p>His face was flushed, and his gray eyes shining as he
stepped from the machine to receive the congratulations
of everybody, even of the bluff post trader.</p>

<p>"I'll try it again this afternoon," said Matt. "That's
enough for this morning. I want to think over my experience,
and see if I can improve my work in any particular
point."</p>

<p>"You wabble a good deal," said Cameron.</p>

<p>"I won't&mdash;when I get the knack."</p>

<p>So that afternoon, and day after day thereafter, Motor
Matt went up and practiced to acquire the "knack." Little
by little it came to him, every flight teaching him
something that it was necessary for him to know.</p>

<p>He went up in still air, in light winds, and in breezes
that made his friends tremble for his safety; but not
once did he get a spill, not once did anything go wrong
with the machinery, and not once did he fail to bring
the <i>June Bug</i> back to earth as gently and easily as he
had done on the morning of his first flight.</p>

<p>Greater and greater crowds assembled to witness the
trials. The people came from Minnewaukon, from
Oberon, and from Devil's Lake City. Even the Indians
gathered from various parts of the reservation, and
gazed stolidly while "Boy-That-Flies-Like-the-Eagle"&mdash;as
they called Matt&mdash;continued to keep on the wing, and
learn the knack.</p>

<p>As Tuesday&mdash;the day of the government test&mdash;drew
nearer, the railroads advertised excursions, and from
the Department of the Missouri came sundry men, high
in the councils of the war department, to see how well
Motor Matt would meet the supreme test.</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon, after Matt had finished a flight
during which he had kept the <i>June Bug</i> almost level in
the air, Lieutenant Cameron caught his hand in a convulsive
grip.</p>

<p>"I'm ready, Matt," said he; "you've got the knack."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DASTARDLY WORK.</p>


<p>Ping was a badly demoralized Chinaman. He had
watched, with soulful admiration, every flight Matt
had made; he had swelled out like a toad every time the
work of his master was applauded in his hearing; and
he crept around Matt as though he was a joss&mdash;a wizard
more superhuman than a mere mortal.</p>

<p>But the <i>June Bug</i> seemed to have become a part of
the Chinaman. He gloated over it, he patted it affectionately,
he crooned strange gibberish to it, and he kept
watch of it while in the air and on the ground as
though it was the apple of his eye.</p>

<p>After Matt had finished his last flight before the Tuesday
trials, Ping crept off into the woods by himself,
dipped some water into a small china bowl, and dropped
into it a cake of India ink. Then he stirred the ink
until it was dissolved, found a big, smooth bowlder that
answered for a table, and squatted down beside it.</p>

<p>First, he placed the china bowl on the bowlder; next,
he brought from the breast of his blouse a camel's-hair
brush, and half a dozen strips of rice paper; then, on
each strip of paper, he began painting potent prayers.</p>

<p>Having finished his peculiar labors, he threw the little
bowl into the lake, hid the slips of rice paper under the
bowlder, put the brush in his pocket, and sneaked back
to Camp Traquair, arriving just in time for supper.</p>

<p>That night Matt went to bed early, and McGlory soon
followed him. The <i>June Bug</i>, drawn up to the left of
the tent, looked like a ghost in the gathering dusk.
Around her were the four armed and alert guards.</p>

<p>Then, again, Ping stole away to the bowlder. On its
flat top he started a little fire of dried twigs, and one
by one he dropped the slips of rice paper into the
blaze.</p>

<p>When the last prayer was consumed, and the fire had
died down to a little heap of white ashes, Ping felt that
he had done everything possible to insure Motor Matt's
safety and success.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when he stole back toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Camp Traquair. He saw a little glow of light in the
vicinity of the aëroplane, and he wondered what it could
be. Creeping forward, he investigated, and laughed at
himself for his fears.</p>

<p>The guards had secured a lantern, and, in its light, they
were smoking and playing cards on a blanket.</p>

<p>With the idea of curling up under one of the wings
of the <i>June Bug</i> and passing the night near the machine,
Ping made a wide detour around the soldiers, and started
toward the aëroplane from the other side.</p>

<p>Suddenly his attention was arrested by a crawling
form moving back and forth, now showing darkly
against the white canvas of the planes, and now vanishing
in the deeper shadow under them.</p>

<p>Presently he heard a queer, rasping note, as of a file
biting into steel. In a second he knew what was going
on.</p>

<p>Siwash Charley was meddling with the aëroplane&mdash;was
weakening it here and there so that an accident
would be certain on the following day.</p>

<p>With his heart in his throat, the Chinese boy arose to
his feet, and started toward the soldiers, his lips framing
a cry.</p>

<p>But the cry was never uttered.</p>

<p>Ping had not taken two steps toward the guards before
he was felled by a cruel blow from behind, and a
black, impenetrable pall dropped over his brain.</p>

<p>"Begorry, what was thot?" exclaimed Sergeant
O'Hara, starting up from his seat on the ground and
looking toward the machine.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, sarg?" asked one of
the others.</p>

<p>"I've a notion, d'ye moind, thot I heard somethin'," answered
O'Hara.</p>

<p>"Your wits are woolgatherin', old man," said another
of the men.</p>

<p>"I'll make sure av it, annyways," averred the sergeant.</p>

<p>Taking the lamp, he walked over to the aëroplane, and
looked under it, inside it, and all around.</p>

<p>"Iverything's all roight, so far as I can see," he reported,
coming back to his comrades, "but divil another
card do I play this noight. To yer posts, iviry wan o'
ye, an' we'll kape our eyes peeled. Th' leftinnint an'
Motor Matt sail in thot machine to-morrow, an' there's
a rumor thot Siwash Charley was seen in Divil's Lake
City th' day. Cut out th' card playin', b'ys. We've done
too much of it already."</p>

<p>In the shadow of the woods, three men were carrying
a senseless Chinaman.</p>

<p>"Let's toss him inter the lake, Siwash," suggested
one of the men.</p>

<p>"What's the good, hey?" answered Siwash. "We'll
rope an' gag him. He'll not be found till too late, an'
mebby he'll never be found."</p>

<p>"But if he saw you, an' recognized who ye was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He didn't; he didn't have time. Put the ropes on
him. Twist a cloth into a gag, Pete."</p>

<p>"The lot o' us would swing fer this if it's ever found
out," demurred Pete.</p>

<p>Ping opened his eyes before the scoundrels had left
him. He recognized Siwash Charley by his voice, and he
saw his face by a ray of moonlight that drifted in among
the trees.</p>

<p>Ping tried to cry out, but his lips were sealed; and he
tried to use his hands and feet, but found them bound.</p>

<p>With an inward groan, he sank back and the night of
unconsciousness once more rolled over him.</p>

<p>When he again revived, the sun was high, and there
was a murmur of life from far off in the direction of
Camp Traquair. He lay on his back, his face upward,
and he could see the high bluffs of the lake, over toward
the post. They were covered with people.</p>

<p>What was the matter? he asked himself. How had
he come there? Why was he bound, and why was the
cloth tied between his jaws?</p>

<p>In a flash, his bewildered mind remembered all that
had happened.</p>

<p>He heard again the rasp of the file biting into steel; he
recalled his suspicions, his attempt to cry out to the
soldiers, the blow that had felled him; then, too, the
moment of consciousness in the woods came back to him,
bringing the raucous voice and ill-omened face of Siwash
Charley.</p>

<p>The aëroplane had been tampered with by Motor
Matt's enemies! And this was Tuesday, the day of the
trials!</p>

<p>If Matt attempted to fly in the <i>June Bug</i>, there would
be an accident, and he would be killed!</p>

<p>Like a demon, the boy fought to free himself. He
must get to Camp Traquair and tell what he had seen
and heard. If he did not, the fiendish work of Siwash
Charley would spell destruction for Motor Matt and
the joss of the clouds.</p>

<p>What passed in that little heathen's mind will never
be known. He was a Chinaman, and the workings of
a Chinaman's mind, while following the same lines as
the workings of a Caucasian's, are yet never quite the
same.</p>

<p>Ping's fight with the cords that bound his wrists and
ankles brought pain and drew blood, and his tongue,
from a frenzied gnawing of the gag, was sore and swollen;
but he could not free himself. Siwash Charley and
his mates had performed their work only too well.</p>

<p>In sheer desperation, Ping attempted to roll in the
direction of Camp Traquair.</p>

<p>He got perhaps twenty feet over the sharp stones and
rough tree-roots, and then his mind faded into an oblivion&mdash;quite
as much the result of his own horrifying
thoughts as of his physical pain and weakness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>He awoke to hear cheers, and to piece together, once
more, his battered notions of the trend of events.</p>

<p>As he lay staring dumbly upward, he saw the cloud
joss winging across the woods like a huge bird, high,
very high in the air.</p>

<p>Motor Matt was there, guiding the joss, and making
it do his will; and beside Motor Matt was Lieutenant
Cameron. Only a moment did the aëroplane show itself
to Ping's restricted vision, and then the tops of the trees
shut it from his sight.</p>

<p>Far away somewhere the helpless boy could hear wild
cheering.</p>

<p>What good were choice prayers, painted on rice paper,
and burned to the heathen deities?</p>

<p>This is what Ping's bruised and quivering mind asked
itself.</p>

<p>By every means in his power, Ping had tried to avert
disaster.</p>

<p>One prayer had been for a calm day. This seemed to
have been answered, for there was hardly a breath stirring
the tree tops.</p>

<p>Another prayer was for a safe start. That, likewise,
must have been answered, or Matt would not now be
on the wing.</p>

<p>Yet another prayer was for the flying machine's
safety while in the air; a fourth had been for the machinery;
a fifth for the wings; a sixth for a safe descent;
a seventh had been general in its terms, and had
most to do with Motor Matt's fame and fortune after
the trial was over.</p>

<p>Ping had burned no prayer for Lieutenant Cameron.
In some manner, he could not understand how, the lieutenant
had escaped his mind.</p>

<p>While he lay there, miserably going over these heathen
things which were all terribly real and important to
him, a roar of fear, horror, and consternation came
from the distance.</p>

<p>Turning his head a little, Ping was able to see people
scrambling over the bluffs, wildly excited.</p>

<p>The accident had happened.</p>

<p>With a groan, Ping closed his eyes, and turned his
face to the earth.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE GOVERNMENT TRIAL.</p>


<p>Matt awoke, on that memorable Tuesday, to find that
fortune was favoring him with a clear sky and not
enough wind to ripple the flag over the tent.</p>

<p>McGlory greeted him in a strangely subdued manner.
The cowboy had a lot on his mind, and Matt
rallied him about his odd reserve.</p>

<p>"Where's Ping?" asked Matt, noting that the little
Chinaman was not hovering around his vicinity as usual.</p>

<p>"Give it up, pard," said McGlory. "Suppose he's off
asking his joss to give you luck."</p>

<p>People were already gathering on the bluffs, and
rounding up in wagons and automobiles in the near
vicinity of Camp Traquair.</p>

<p>While Matt was looking over the aëroplane, Cameron
brought several dignified, gold-laced officers, who had
come from distant points to witness the trials. The
lieutenant presented them, and the boyish, unaffected
manner of the young motorist had a good effect on the
representatives of the war department.</p>

<p>"You understand, do you, Motor Matt," said one of
these gentlemen, "that you are to stay aloft two hours,
with one passenger, and travel at the rate of thirty
miles an hour?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Matt. "I can stay aloft three
hours just as well as two, and I think you will see the
aëroplane do fifty miles instead of thirty."</p>

<p>The officers smiled at his enthusiasm. But they liked
it, for it proved that his heart was in his work.</p>

<p>"Don't push the machine too hard," counseled one of
the officers.</p>

<p>"I'll not do that, sir," said Matt. "Before I take up
the lieutenant, I'll go up alone, to make sure that everything
is working well. I have just found one of the
propeller blades loosened&mdash;and that looks a good deal
as though some one had been tampering with the machine.
Of course, however," he added, "that's impossible,
for the aëroplane has been guarded night and
day."</p>

<p>"I'd wager my life on O'Hara," put in Cameron, confidently.
"He had charge of last night's detail."</p>

<p>As Matt's examination went further, he found bolts
loose, here and there. In fact, so many parts were weakened
that the general result could hardly be called accidental.
However, he liked O'Hara, and did not want
to overturn the lieutenant's trust in him. So, saying
nothing, he went on carefully with his examination, tightening
everything that was loose.</p>

<p>At last he was satisfied that the aëroplane was in
as good trim as ever.</p>

<p>"I'm a little late in starting," said he to McGlory and
Cameron, "but it's always well to be on the safe side.
Be ready, old chap," he added to the lieutenant, "when
I come back from this little trial spin."</p>

<p>In a way that had become an old story to him and
his friends, but which was intensely new and novel to
nine out of every ten of the onlookers, Matt started the
<i>June Bug</i> along the road, lifted her into the air, and
sailed her far out over the bluff and the lake.</p>

<p>Everything was working as well as usual. The air
craft met the strain in every part, seemingly as staunch
as she had always been. At a leisurely jog&mdash;just enough
to keep the aëroplane afloat with the wings but slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
tilted&mdash;Matt turned above the lake and glided back to
his starting point.</p>

<p>He had done no man&oelig;uvring, attempted no speed, and
had not tried to break his record for staying aloft.
Nevertheless, the military representatives were enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"Wait until you see Matt put the machine through her
paces," said the lieutenant, smiling confidently at his
senior officer, as he took his place in the machine.</p>

<p>Two signal corps privates ran with the <i>June Bug</i> to
give her a start. The added weight of the lieutenant
made her a little slower in taking the air, and not quite
so swift in mounting upward, but Matt soon found that
she was more easily managed with this additional ballast.</p>

<p>"By Jove," cried the lieutenant delightedly, "but this
is fine! North Dakota has turned out a lot of people to
see this exhibition, Matt. The bluffs are black with them,
and everywhere you look you can see people with their
faces upturned, either gaping in wonder or yelling
with delight. Hear 'em cheer! I should think it would
make your blood tingle."</p>

<p>"I haven't any time for all that," said Matt, busy with
his levers, and watching everything with a keen, alert
eye; "I've got something else to keep track of. You're
watching the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was ten-fifteen when we started."</p>

<p>Matt slowly speeded up the engine. The route, as
already determined on, was to be across Devil's Lake and
back, and then to Minnewaukon and back, going over
the course as many times as he could during the two
hours the aëroplane must stay in the air.</p>

<p>At a height of fifty feet above the surface of the earth,
their flight through the air became a swirling rush. At
top speed&mdash;a speed which Matt reckoned as fifty miles
an hour&mdash;he made a wide, sweeping turn over the roof
tops of Devil's Lake City, and plunged off across the
lake. A frenzy of cheering arose from the bluffs and
Camp Traquair as the aëroplane darted over them on
her way to Minnewaukon.</p>

<p>"Can't we go higher, Matt?" begged the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"We'll go higher after we make the turn over Minnewaukon,"
Matt replied.</p>

<p>After that, Cameron did not bother Matt with questions.
The young motorist's every faculty was wrapped
up in his work. His ear alone told him how well the
motor was doing, and his eyes, ears, and his sense of
touch were brought into play in preserving the aëroplane's
equilibrium.</p>

<p>The merest rise of one wing caused a mechanical shifting
of the lever on which Matt constantly held his left
hand.</p>

<p>That left hand of the young motorist had been trained
to its work in many an automobile race, and its quickness
and cunning did not fail him now.</p>

<p>There were some people still left in Minnewaukon&mdash;not
all the town's inhabitants had gone to the bluffs
or to Camp Traquair. Those that remained in the place
assembled on the streets or on the roof tops, and cheered
wildly as the aëroplane veered in a circle and rushed
back toward Totten.</p>

<p>The official recorder was here, as in Devil's Lake City,
noting the time, and jotting it down on a pad of paper.</p>

<p>Once turned toward Camp Traquair, Matt sent the
aëroplane resolutely upward. Up and still up the craft
glided, forced by the whirling propeller and supported
by the air under the planes.</p>

<p>"How high do you think we are now, Cameron?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Three hundred feet, I should say," replied Cameron.</p>

<p>"I guess that will do. It's easier sailing up here. The
air close to the earth's surface is in a constant state
of agitation, but at this height it's quieter. Don't you
notice how much smoother we're gliding?"</p>

<p>"I've been noticing that," said Cameron. "It's like a
boat on a mill pond, only we're traveling like an express
train."</p>

<p>Again they were over Camp Traquair, and again the
wild cheering of the crowds reached their ears. They
crossed the lake, turned, once more hovered over Camp
Traquair, then glided downward to a height of a hundred
feet, and rushed over the air line to Minnewaukon.</p>

<p>Three times they made the round trip. As they were
coming back from Minnewaukon the third time, Cameron
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"The two hours are up, Matt," he announced, "and I
am almost sorry for it. We'd better go down. You
have won the test on every point, and the sale of the
aëroplane to the government is assured. If you had a
hand free, I'd give you a hearty grip along with my
congratulations."</p>

<p>"Keep that until we land," laughed Matt.</p>

<p>The cheering came up to them like Bedlam let loose
as they drew near Camp Traquair, and Matt slackened
the pace, preparatory to descending.</p>

<p>Then it was that the unexpected&mdash;so far as Matt was
concerned&mdash;happened.</p>

<p>There came a snap like the crack of a pistol, and Matt
had a sudden vision of a writhing wire rope coiling
viciously in the air. It missed him, but struck the lieutenant
on the forehead.</p>

<p>Instinctively the lieutenant arose on the footboard, and
tossed his arms. It was a fierce blow he had received,
and unconsciousness had claimed him. Staggering in
midair, he would have tottered off into space had it not
been for the king of the motor boys.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, Motor Matt caught the lieutenant's
arm just in time to keep him from falling.</p>

<p>The accident was witnessed by the thousands of spectators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
gathered below. For an instant it seemed as
though the fluttering aëroplane would be overturned and
come rushing earthward; then, as the horrified people
watched, the reeling lieutenant was dragged out of
sight between the canvas planes, the aëroplane righted
suddenly, glided downward, and dropped on her wheels
in the road.</p>

<p>Matt's face was white, but his voice was steady as he
called to those who were rushing toward the machine.</p>

<p>"Cameron is only stunned&mdash;he'll be all right in a
little while. Here, lift him out and lay him on the
ground."</p>

<p>One of the epauletted, gold-laced officers brushed a
handkerchief across his forehead with a shaking hand.</p>

<p>"If he lives," said the officer, "he'll owe his life to
Motor Matt. I never saw anything like that before, and
I hope I never shall again. Gad, how it strains a man's
nerves."</p>

<p>When Cameron was removed from the machine, Matt
passed to the forward planes and examined the end of
the broken wire guy.</p>

<p>"It was notched with a file," he asserted, "and for
more than two hours Cameron and I have been playing
with death, hundreds of feet in the air."</p>

<p>He passed rapidly to the wire stay supporting the forward
planes on the opposite side.</p>

<p>"This, also, is notched," he added. "If this guy had
snapped, nothing could have saved us!"</p>

<p>"What murderous scoundrel could have done it?" demanded
a dozen fierce voices.</p>

<p>"His name is Siwash Charley," said Matt. "It must
have been done last night. Find the scoundrel, if you
can; he should be made to answer for this."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">FAME&mdash;AND A LITTLE FORTUNE.</p>


<p>"The returns are in from Devil's Lake City and Minnewaukon.
Time, two hours and seven minutes. Distance
traveled, ninety miles. This was at the rate of
a little less than forty-five miles an hour, and the government
ought to be completely satisfied. I know I am.
Motor Matt, allow me to congratulate you."</p>

<p>One of the officers was doing the speaking.</p>

<p>It was three hours after the sensational finish of the
trial. The crowds had departed. McGlory, a few officers,
Cameron, and Matt were in the tent at Camp Traquair.
Cameron, his head bandaged, was lying on a cot,
but he was wide awake and smiling.</p>

<p>"I knew he could do the trick," said Cameron; "in
fact, I've been confident of that ever since I saw him
wabble around on his first flight with the aëroplane.
What beats me, though, is how those ropes became
notched."</p>

<p>"Sergeant O'Hara thinks he knows how it happened,"
explained the officer who had read off the <i>June Bug's</i>
record. "He and the other three guards were having a
game of seven-up, last night, when they should have
been giving their entire attention to watching the aëroplane.
O'Hara thought he heard a noise around the
machine. He investigated, but found no cause for uneasiness.
After that, O'Hara declares, the card playing
stopped; but, it now seems clear, the evil had already
been done."</p>

<p>"We don't know that this fellow calling himself Siwash
Charley was the scoundrel who filed the guy
ropes," spoke up another officer.</p>

<p>"It's a positive certainty, in my own mind," declared
Cameron.</p>

<p>"What your individual belief is, lieutenant, would
hardly stand at a court-martial, or in a court of law."</p>

<p>"That's true, yes, sir. Siwash Charley was seen in
Devil's Lake City yesterday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Circumstantial, but hardly conclusive. He can't be
found now. Fully a hundred men have been looking
for him and are now on the trail, but Siwash Charley,
if he was here, has vanished."</p>

<p>"I'm too happy over the way everything came out,"
put in Matt, "to waste any thoughts on Siwash Charley.
The aëroplane has made good. There's no doubt about
the sale to the government?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," came a chorus from the officers.</p>

<p>"There can't possibly be, Matt," added Cameron.</p>

<p>"That telegram of mine was sent to Mrs. Traquair?"
Matt went on.</p>

<p>"It was sent from the post within half an hour after
the aëroplane landed. By this time, Mrs. Traquair
knows what Motor Matt has done for her."</p>

<p>"It wasn't that that I wanted her to understand, but
the fact that a little fortune had come to her, and that
she was no longer in the clutches of that loan shark,
Murgatroyd."</p>

<p>"She knows that, too. A little fortune, I understand,
has also come to Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"And more fame," put in McGlory, "than one modest
young chap like my pard knows how to shoulder."</p>

<p>"What little fortune there is," smiled Matt, "is to
be divided with my chum, Joe McGlory, who was a
bigger help to me than I imagine he realized. Part of
the fame should be his, too."</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" chuckled the cowboy.
"Fame! Oh, yes, I ought to be plastered with it. Why,
I wouldn't have gone up in the <i>June Bug</i> for all the
fame they tacked onto Napoleon."</p>

<p>There was a general laugh at this.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's become of Ping?" Matt inquired
anxiously. "It isn't like him to hide out on us, in this
fashion. The last I saw of him was last night."</p>

<p>"There is something queer about that," averred McGlory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
"He ought to have been around to exult, Ping
had, and it's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>O'Hara stuck his head in at the tent flap, just at that
moment.</p>

<p>"Beggin' yer pardon, sors, but there's an Injun just
come, totin' a half-baked Chink. Do yez want thim
insoide?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" cried Matt. "Send them in."</p>

<p>A Sioux Indian, looking anything but the noble red
man in his moccasins and coat, hat, and trousers, pigeon
toed his way into the tent with a brief but respectful
"How!"</p>

<p>Behind him, half carried and half dragged, came
Ping!</p>

<p>The boy was a sight.</p>

<p>He was bareheaded and barefooted; his usually neat
blouse and baggy trousers were torn and soiled; his
hands were bleeding, and there was a wild, despairing
look on his yellow face. The wildness and the despair
vanished, however, when he caught sight of Matt.</p>

<p>"By Klismas!" he gurgled. "Shiwas Charley no
killee Motol Matt? Hoop-a-la!" and Ping ran to Matt
and dropped down on his knees in front of him, hugging
one of his hands in a maudlin expression of joy.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Ping?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Allee same woods. Shiwas makee tie hands and
feet, stoppee talk with gag. Whoosh! My thinkee
you go topside, my no come tellee what Shiwas do.
Velly bad pidgin!"</p>

<p>Then, little by little, Matt got the whole story of
Ping's experience.</p>

<p>"You are positive Siwash Charley was one of the
men who knocked you down, here at the camp, and
carried you into the woods?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"My savvy Shiwas plenty much," declared Ping.</p>

<p>"I guess there's our proof, gentlemen," said Cameron.
"Siwash can't dodge that."</p>

<p>"Hardly," said one of the officers. "If Siwash is
caught, he'll be taken care of. What a dastardly piece
of work! What made the fellow such an enemy of
yours, Matt?"</p>

<p>"He was only a tool in the hands of another," said
Matt. "That other man was an enemy of Traquair's,
and the fellow didn't want the aëroplane to stand the test
she faced to-day. The money Mrs. Traquair is to receive
will enable her to pay a mortgage which this other
scoundrel holds on a quarter section of land in Wells
County."</p>

<p>"And all this double-dealing is about a mortgage on
a quarter section of prairie land! It hardly seems possible."</p>

<p>"There is something about that land I don't understand,"
admitted Matt. "But that's the way the matter
stands, anyhow, no matter what is back of the mortgage.
The government, I presume," he added, "merely
buys the aëroplane? What it pays for the machine
isn't a purchase of Traquair's patents?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," went on the officer who had been doing
most of the talking. "The government simply buys
this aëroplane, called the&mdash;er&mdash;the <i>June Bug</i>&mdash;a name,
by the way, which I don't fancy&mdash;and the government
likewise secures the right to purchase any other aëroplane
using the Traquair patents, or to build such machines
itself, paying Traquair's heirs at law a royalty."</p>

<p>"That," said Matt, "is liable to make Mrs. Traquair
a rich woman."</p>

<p>"Well, hardly, unless the government goes into the
aëroplane business rather more extensively than I think.
Still, Mrs. Traquair should be assured of a modest competence,
say, a hundred thousand dollars, or such a
matter."</p>

<p>McGlory reeled on his chair.</p>

<p>"Modest competence!" he gulped. "Sufferin' poorhouses!
Why, Mrs. Traquair wouldn't know how to
spend a quarter of that money. She&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tillygram, sor," announced O'Hara, again thrusting
his head through the tent flap. "It jist came down
from th' post an' has th' name av Motor Matt on th'
face av ut."</p>

<p>Matt took the envelope and tore it open. His face

<h2><a name="TRICKED_BY_TWO" id="TRICKED_BY_TWO">TRICKED BY TWO.</a></h2>

<p class="center">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>Neatly ensconced under the bed clothes, and with its horrible
fleshless head laid in ghastly mockery upon his pillow,
was a human skeleton.</p>

<p>For a moment Guy Hereford stared at the hideous object.
Then recovering himself with a strong effort, he shouted
violently for his boy Rufus.</p>

<p>The negro came into the room, showing a double row of
magnificent ivories in a grin that stretched almost from ear
to ear.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Rufe?" demanded Guy angrily,
pointing to the skull on his pillow.</p>

<p>"Doan' you get excited, boss," said the nigger, still grinning.
"I done dat. I been all day gettin' him. Nebber had
such a job in all my bawn days."</p>

<p>"Have you gone clean crazy?" cried Guy in amazed perplexity.</p>

<p>"No, sah. <i>Dat you!</i>" was Rufe's amazing reply. "Doan'
you be angry, boss," he went on hurriedly, as Guy stepped
suddenly toward him. "I done discovered a splendiferous
plan to obfuscate dat dar Deacon, and dat am part ob de
invention. I tell you dat am you."</p>

<p>Guy was beyond speech. He could only gaze helplessly at
the beaming face of the negro.</p>

<p>Rufus, proud as a peacock, condescended to explain. "It
dis way, sah. You going to build a new house soon, ain't
you?"</p>

<p>"I was," replied Guy gloomily.</p>

<p>"Dat all right, den. Now, doan' you be down-hearted, sah.
Dis niggah bossing dis heah job."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake explain, Rufe," exclaimed Guy.</p>

<p>"I goin' to, sah. It dis way. Dis am de time for burning
de woods, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Guy nodded. For the life of him he could not imagine
what the man was driving at.</p>

<p>"An' grass am good an' long right up to de back ob de
garden?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Den dis my plan, sah. I set out fire in de woods to-night,
set him in ten, twelve places. Dere's a win' blowin'
from de west. Ef we doan' touch it de house burn down
sure." He paused with an illuminating chuckle.</p>

<p>Light began to dawn on Guy.</p>

<p>"You mean," he said slowly, "that we're to burn down
the shanty and make them think that I've burned in it. That
skeleton's to be me."</p>

<p>"You done hit de bull's face in once, sah!" cried the negro
in high delight. "Dat just de way I figure it out. In de
morning dat no-'count Deacon, he come round to see you an'
find out if you done got de money for him. Den he find
nothin' but de burned-up house an' de burned-up bones."</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, Rufe, I believe it's workable," exclaimed
Guy, a light of hope appearing on his puzzled face.</p>

<p>"In course it am workable, sah. Deacon, he can't get no
money from a daid man. Dat one thing mighty sure!"</p>

<p>"But won't he suspect anything?" suggested Guy.</p>

<p>"Not if dis niggah still alive," declared Rufe emphatically.
"I tell you, Marse Guy, I goin' to do down dat man proper.
He find me hyah, just a-howlin' and a-carryin' on ober dem
ole bones, an' I tell him all about how de fire come in out ob
de woods an' how it cotch de house, an' how I done try to
pull you out. Oh, I fool him 'to eights.'"</p>

<p>Guy couldn't help laughing. Rufe's enjoyment over the
prospective humbugging of Deacon was so intense.</p>

<p>"You see, Marse Guy," went on Rufe eagerly, "Deacon
he be so glad to think you daid, he never bother to t'ink
whether you foolin' him. He next heir, an' all he t'ink be to
get de place an' all de t'ings dat belong to you. He nebber
go to dat inquisition at all."</p>

<p>"And what's to become of me in the meantime?" asked
Guy.</p>

<p>"You got money, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, luckily I've got twenty dollars or so in the house."</p>

<p>"Well, dat all right. Take de train an' go down to Tampa
on de Gulf. Swimmin' in de sea do you a power o' good,
boss. I reckon you better take some oder name an' den
walk down an' cotch de train at some place furder down de
line dan Pine Lake."</p>

<p>After a little more talk Guy and his man settled up all
the details. It was agreed that the house should be sacrificed,
and that Guy himself should temporarily disappear and go
down to Tampa. After the inquest on Blissett, Rufe was to
write to him there at the post office and tell him how things
turned out.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that Dandy had to be left behind. It
would arouse suspicion if the pony were taken away. But
Guy, who was anxious above all things that his horse should
not fall into Deacon's hands, even for a few days, thought of
a way out of the difficulty. He gave Rufe a note for his
wages for two months, and told him that on the following
day he was to go into Pine Lake and file a lien on the pony
for his pay.</p>

<p>Then the two set to work to take Guy's few articles of
value out of the shanty and hide them. This they did by
rolling them in a big rubber blanket and burying them in the
dry, sandy soil in the orange grove.</p>

<p>This took some little time, and it was nearly eleven o'clock
when Guy was at last ready to go.</p>

<p>"Now, mind you, Rufe," were his last words to the negro,
"don't you overdo it, and don't let Deacon see that you hate
him. A little soft sawder won't do any harm."</p>

<p>"Doan' you worry your haid, boss," replied Rufe consolingly.
"I reckon I keep up my end agains' Deacon or any of
dem folk. To-morrow, after I seen Deacon, I go to Pine
Lake an' hear de inquest on Blissett. Den I write an' tell
you all dat happen."</p>

<p>Guy nodded. "I shall be desperately anxious to hear the
verdict," he said. "If Deacon doesn't give evidence, the
worst they're likely to return is manslaughter."</p>

<p>"Doan' you worry, boss," said Rufe confidently. "I reckon
it am going to be 'justificational homeyside.' Deacon, he
won't give no evidence. He be too busy gettin' ready to
move over heah."</p>

<p>"Only hope so," said Guy. "Now, good-by, Rufe. Remember
all I've told you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Master and man shook hands, and Guy, slinging a small
bag across his shoulder on a stick, walked away from the
shanty which had been his only home for four long years
of hard work and happiness, and disappeared into the forest.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before a flickering glow gleamed
redly on the serried ranks of tall, straight trunks.</p>

<p>He turned. Half a dozen pin points of fire were visible
on the far side of the clearing. They grew rapidly, and
presently the night sky was all aglow with leaping tongues
of flame.</p>

<p>The soft breeze which soughed through the tops of the
pines sent the flames sweeping down upon the little house,
which stood a squat, black mass between the watcher and
the blaze behind.</p>

<p>Fascinated by the sight, Guy stood motionless, watching
the destruction sweep upon his home.</p>

<p>The many little fires joined forces, and Guy could plainly
hear the roar and crackle as the tall, dry grass burst into
hissing sparks. There was little chance of any one interfering
to save the house. Now that Blissett was dead Guy
had no neighbor within a mile, and in the spring of the year
fires are too frequent in the Florida woods for any one to pay
attention. The cattlemen are always busy burning off the
old grass to get fresh pasture for their herds.</p>

<p>Now the whole sky was alight, and the blaze illuminated
the sleeping woods far and near. Red-hot sparks were falling
like rain upon the shingle roof of the cabin.</p>

<p>Another minute, and little streaks of red fire were winding
like snakes about the eaves.</p>

<p>"She's going," muttered Guy sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Yes, once the fire got hold of the sun-dried pine of which
the house was built the flames rushed up in great leaping
columns. The place burned like a tar barrel, and the glow
became so intense that Guy shrank away further into the
woods for fear of being observed by any one who might
possibly have been attracted by the blaze.</p>

<p>Still he could not tear himself away from the sight of the
destruction of his old home. Sheltering behind a huge pine
trunk, he watched till, with a loud crash and a hurricane
of sparks, the roof fell in, and of the shanty no more remained
than a shapeless pile.</p>

<p>With a deep sigh Guy Hereford turned away, and never
stopped until at four o'clock in the morning he boarded the
south-bound mail train at the small wayside station of
Kissochee.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Any letter for George Hatfield?"</p>

<p>The smart clerk took up a bundle of letters, ran them
rapidly through, and flung them down. "Nope!"</p>

<p>Guy Hereford's face fell.</p>

<p>"Quite sure?" he asked.</p>

<p>The clerk glared.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" he asked sharply, and the other
turned slowly away.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" he thought uneasily. "Why hasn't
Rufe written?"</p>

<p>He was hardly outside the post office before a bare-legged
nigger boy thrust a paper in his face. "Here y'are, boss.
<i>Tampa Sentinel!</i> All de details ob de horrific tragedy up in
Orange County."</p>

<p>Guy grabbed a paper, shoved a quarter into the astonished
youngster's hand, and, without waiting for change, was off
like a shot.</p>

<p>He reached his room in the boarding house where he had
put up, and tore the paper open.</p>

<p>Yes, here it was&mdash;a whole column!</p>

<p>"Strange double tragedy near Pine Lake! Well-known
cattleman killed. His nearest neighbor burned to death.
Two inquests in one day."</p>

<p>So much for the headlines.</p>

<p>Guy gave a deep sigh of relief. "Nothing about murder,
anyhow," he muttered.</p>

<p>Then he began to read rapidly. Slowly his expression of
anxiety changed to relief, and then to amusement. Finally
he burst into a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"Fine! Dandy!" he cried. "My good Oliver, you are a
peach, and no mistake. This is the absolute limit." And
dropping the paper he lay back in his chair and laughed till
the tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Dat am too bad, Marse Guy. I nebber t'ink you heah
it all from dat fool newspaper."</p>

<p>The deep voice made Guy fairly jump. Springing to his
feet he swung round, and there was Rufe, dressed in his
best Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes, and with an expression of
deep annoyance on his ebony face.</p>

<p>"You Rufe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah. I come down all de way by de train to tell
you de news, an' now dat blame paper done tole you de
whole t'ing."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, Rufe. It hasn't told me half. If you
hadn't turned up I should have taken the next train back
to see you and find out just what has happened. Tell me, is
Deacon in possession?"</p>

<p>Rufe, somewhat mollified, grinned. "Yes, boss, he dar
right enough. He camping in de stable."</p>

<p>"Hasn't got Dandy, I hope?" put in Guy anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, sah. Dandy in de libery stable at Pine Lake."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Now go on. Tell me what happened.
Did he come over yesterday morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah; he come ober about ten. An' you ought to hab
seen his face when he foun' de house burned!"</p>

<p>"He asked for me, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he done ask for you at once, an' I show him de
bones, an' tell him you all burned up. Fust he look flabbergasted,
den he sort o' chuckle, and I feel like whanging him
one ober de haid."</p>

<p>"What happened then?"</p>

<p>"He act like he think he boss an' I his niggah. He tell me
go get a wagon an' carry de bones into Pine Lake. Say it
sabe trouble hab one inquisition 'stead ob two. I act meek,
an go borrow a spring wagon an' hitch Dandy up, an' we
take de bones in, an' he tell de sheriff. I t'ink dat sheriff
kind ob like you, Marse Guy. He mighty worried. Den he
say; 'Quite right. Hab one inquisition on bofe de bodies.'"</p>

<p>"Did you go, Rufe?"</p>

<p>"You bet I go, boss. Firs' dey hab Blissett's body. All
dem cracker chaps look at de haid, an' Deacon he gib evidence
an say he seen it all. He say dat Blissett done tried
to shoot you, and you didn't hab no pistol, but you was real
brave an' ride hard at him, an' knock him off de hawse, an'
de hawse kick him an' run away into de woods."</p>

<p>Rufe stopped to chuckle at the remembrance. Guy
laughed too. He quite understood Deacon's motive.</p>

<p>His cousin wanted to pose in a good light before the jury,
so that there could be no chance of suspicion falling on him
that he was implicated in his&mdash;Guy's&mdash;death.</p>

<p>"Den de sheriff he get up an' say dat you was a very nice
gen'elman," went on Rufe, "an' dat Mistah Deacon's evidence
was very straight, an' dat dere was only one verdict
for dem to give, an' dat he left de matter in dere hands.</p>

<p>"So dey just talk a bit among demselves, an' den de foreman,
old Abe Mizell, he get up and say dat dey was all
agreed dat Harvey Blissett was killed 'cause his skull not so
hard as de heel ob his hawse.</p>

<p>"Den dey hab de bones in, an' I gib evidence." Rufe
swelled with pride.</p>

<p>"What did you say, Rufe?"</p>

<p>"Dey ask me if I could 'dentify dem dere bones. I say I
reckon dey mus' be you's, 'cause I find 'em in among de cinders
ob your bed. I couldn't sw'ar, I tole 'em, because I
warn't dar when it happens. I tell 'em I coming home from
courting my gal, an' see de fire an' run; but t'ain't no good.
I too late. All burned up before I get dar. Anyhow, I ain't
seed you since."</p>

<p>"So they gave it accidental death?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sah. Dat's what dey said, and said dey was sorry,
'cause you was a promising young gen'elman."</p>

<p>"And what did Deacon do?" anxiously inquired Guy.</p>

<p>"He go round to de record office to get your land put in
his name," chuckled Rufe. "Den I see him ride out on a
libery stable hawse."</p>

<p>Guy roared.</p>

<p>"I reckon it going to be de wors' shock he ebber get in his
life when you rides up to de ole place," remarked Rufe presently.</p>

<p>"I rather expect it will," replied Guy feebly, wiping his
eyes. "Come on, Rufe. There's a train back at twelve-thirty.
Just time for dinner, and then the sooner we're home again
the better."</p>

<p>Guy's first task, when he arrived at Pine Lake, was to
call on Anderson the sheriff.</p>

<p>Anderson, who was fat and fifty, went positively purple
at sight of the man upon whom he had held an inquest!</p>

<p>Guy told him the whole story, all about the quarrel between
himself and Blissett, about Deacon's threats and Rufe's
plan. The only thing he did not mention was the fact that
Deacon had stolen and sold Blissett's horse.</p>

<p>Anderson listened first in amazement, then with amusement,
and finally went off into a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"That Rufe's a wonder," he said. "I didn't reckon there
was a nigger in Florida with that much sense. But, look
here, young fellow, you've been taking mighty big liberties
with the law. According to law you're dead, and buried, too.
What d'ye reckon we're going to do about that?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, I'm sure, Mr. Anderson. That's what I
came to you about," replied Guy coolly.</p>

<p>"Reckoned I could fix it for you, eh?" There was a sly
twinkle in old Anderson's eyes. "I guess I'll have to try.
But, say, don't you go wasting time in here. Ef that thar
cousin o' yours hears as you ain't as dead as he hed supposed,
chances are he'll be getting his gun."</p>

<p>"All right, sheriff," said Guy. "I'll get along. I am under
obligations to you about the business. I'm afraid it's given
you a lot of bother."</p>

<p>"I ain't kicking," said Anderson dryly. "The State pays
my fees for an inquest. Good-by."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Guy and Rufe were in a hired buggy,
with Dandy in the shafts, spinning lightly homeward over
the sandy roads.</p>

<p>It was dusk when they reached the gate.</p>

<p>"So you've brought the horse back," came a sharp voice
as Rufe pulled up in front of the stable. "A mighty good
job you did. Take him out and tie him up. Then you can
sling your hook as fast as you like."</p>

<p>"What for should I git from my boss' land?" asked Rufe
with such a delightfully innocent air that Guy, close by under
a tree, almost laughed out loud.</p>

<p>"Git!" Deacon roared, "or by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A muscular hand gripped him by the back of the neck,
and cut short his sentence.</p>

<p>Deacon squirmed round. His eyes fell on Guy Hereford;
he gave a scream like a woman's, and dropped as if he'd been
shot in the head.</p>

<p>"Now, Oliver," said Guy quietly. "Perhaps you'll be good
enough to explain what the thunder you mean by coming and
camping on my property."</p>

<p>The man rose slowly to his feet, and his eyes were venomous.
"So you tricked me," he ground out between clinched
teeth.</p>

<p>"Well, I rather think we did. Rufe and I between us,"
replied Guy coolly.</p>

<p>Deacon burst into a storm of furious invective. He cursed
Guy by everything he could think of. At last he wound up.</p>

<p>"You needn't think you've got the best of me. I'll raise
the country against you. They'll have to have one inquest
over again. I'll see they have both. I don't care what happens
to me. I'll see you hung yet. I swear it."</p>

<p>Guy waited until the other stopped, exhausted.</p>

<p>Then he said very quietly: "Oliver, what's the punishment
for horse stealing? Five years' penitentiary, isn't it? I think
that's the minimum."</p>

<p>It was quite enough. Deacon went white as ashes.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," said Guy with sudden sternness. "If
you're anywhere in Orange County this time to-morrow I'll
denounce you for stealing and selling Harvey Blissett's
horse."</p>

<p>Without another word Deacon slunk off into the gloom.</p>

<p>Guy never again set eyes upon him, for less than six
months later the ruffian was killed in a brawl with a Cuban
cigar maker.</p>

<h2><a name="IDAHO_TO_FEED_ELKS" id="IDAHO_TO_FEED_ELKS">IDAHO TO FEED ELKS.</a></h2>


<p>An effort will be made by the State to prevent as far as
possible a repetition of the wanton destruction of large
numbers of elk which took place in Fremont County last
winter.</p>

<p>The animals had been driven by extreme hunger to approach
the settlements, and, weak from starvation and struggling
in the unusually deep snow when they reached the
lowlands, were killed and skinned. In many cases, reduced
to mere skeletons, their meat could not be used.</p>

<p>The idea of the game warden is to arrange if possible to
have cheap hay shipped into the country where the elk
abound and place it where the animals, when their natural
food supply gives out, will be able to find food. Several of
the ranches in the elk country have put out hay for the
animals for a number of years, and they have not been long
in locating it when the snow gets deep in the hills. In this
manner they are enabled to keep in good condition throughout
the winter, and when spring arrives return to their
usual haunts.</p>

<p>The eastern part of the State forms the principal range
for these animals which the authorities are endeavoring to
protect from the pot hunters and specimen seekers. Stringent
laws have been enacted, which, if carried out, will go
a great way toward protecting the king of North American
game animals.</p>

<h2><a name="NOISY_AVIANS" id="NOISY_AVIANS">NOISY AVIANS.</a></h2>


<p>The bellbird, which makes perhaps, in its natural state,
the greatest noise of any known avian, is found both in
South America and certain parts of Africa. Its voice will
carry on a still day a distance of quite three miles. Its note
is like the tolling of a distant church bell, and is uttered
during the heat of the day, when every other bird has ceased
to sing and nature is hushed in silence. The hornbill, a bird
which is widely distributed in India, the Malay Archipelago,
and Africa, has also a very loud note. Its call has been described
as "between the shriek of a locomotive and the bray
of a donkey," and can be heard a distance of a couple of
miles.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="FISH_THAT_CANNOT_SWIM" id="FISH_THAT_CANNOT_SWIM">FISH THAT CANNOT SWIM.</a></h2>


<p>More than one species of fish that cannot swim are known
to naturalists. Perhaps the most singular of these is the
maltha, a Brazilian fish, whose organs of locomotion only
enable it to crawl or walk or hop. The anterior (pectoral)
fins of the maltha, which are quite small, are not capable
of acting on the water, but can only move backward and
forward, having truly the form of thin paws. Both these and
the ventral and anal fins are very different from the similar
fins in other fishes, and could not serve for swimming at all.
Other examples of non-swimming fishes include the sea-horse,
another most peculiarly shaped inhabitant of the sea,
and the starfish.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
